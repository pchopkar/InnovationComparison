2004,IDEATN003784,S Vijayarajan,TAMIL NADU,VIRUDHUNAGAR,Develop an alternative technology /methods of milk pasteurization other than heat treatment and  IoT based solution with interactive dashboards,NO,"The pasteurization processes which are now emerging employ higher temperatures than the 161 ?F specified for the High Temperature Short time method and employ holding times of the order of only one second. Advocates of these higher heat processes claim numerous advantages, including better kill of the natural milk flora, better product keeping quality, and improvement of flavor. They also state that these processes require less space within the plant. Problems associated with the acceptance of these processes for pasteurization by health officials, for the most part, are the same as those which had to be resolved for both the 30-minute holding and high temperature short-time methods. They vary substantially, however, in range and degree. In essence, the problems are: (a) establishment of an operating standard of time and temperature for effective pasteurization in the high heat range (b) development of specifications for equipment and controls which will assure conformance with the standard during all phases of operation and under conditions of credible failure and (c) assessment of the processes and equipment for side effects which might be deleterious to the product or to the public health.91310Time to time update of milk condition to the Dairy division using IOT  131082269Advanced three layered two chamber containers for preserving.131082269The whole system is transportable in working condition.","Pasteurization of milk on a commercial scale originated in the early part of this century as a continuous flow process in which milk was brought to pasteurization temperature during passage through heating equipment and then promptly cooled. The process was introduced primarily as a means of enhancing the keeping quality8226 of milk and, for the most part, was rejected as a public health measure because of insufficient information on the thermal destruction of pathogenic microorganisms in the temperature ranges of the process and because no controls were available which would assure a continuous and consistent process temperature. Consequently, as the public health benefits of pasteurization were recognized, early emphasis was placed on holding methods of pasteurization which could be based on the observed thermal death times of pathogens and which were readily controllable by manual means.13101310.

Acceptance was predicated on an increased knowledge of thermal destruction characteristics of milkbome, pathogens, on technological advances in the design of control instruments and processing equipment, and on plant level studies on destruction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Controls had been designed which would maintain product temperature within rather narrow limits and which could be interlocked with a pump which would stop operating if the temperature should drop below the point at which the control was set. In addition, pumps had been developed which were acceptable under contemporary standards 8226 of sanitary construction and which would deliver milk at a reasonably uniform rate so that a holding time could be provides under flow renditions.","Pasteurization is the process from which the milk is preserved for a long time. In this method we are including three-layer two chamber storage tank, a cooling system, high voltage unit, 2x one way valve, 3x pumps, milk quality testing unit, IOT system and connecting aluminum pipes.131082269The cooling system is the main part used to preserve the milk for a long time.

The human face is an important entity which plays a crucial role in our daily social interaction, like conveying individuals identity. Face recognition system is also able to recognize the person from a distance without touching or any interaction with the person. Currently, face recognition applications are deployed in social media websites like Facebook, in the entrance of Airports, Railways Stations, Bus Stop, highly secured areas, advertisement, and health care. The purpose of these applications is to minimize criminal activities, fake authentication, tracking addictive gamblers in casinos, whereas Facebook is using face recognition system for automatic tagging purpose. One of the major issues in the modern environment of complex data systems is authentication several strategies are used to address this issue. Face recognition is regarded as one of the most dependable solutions.

This invention generally relates to a cold storage unit. The cold storage unit is operated based on the refrigeration system. More particularly this invention relates to a cold storage unit in trawler.  This invention is mainly concentrated on storage of fresh fish for a period of 7 to 15days. The storage of fresh fish may be carried out with the help of cold storage unit. Fishes caught in the deep sea can be stored for up to 15 days and then rapidly become inedible.  The fishes caught in tropical water region may be edible for even longer periods (more than 15 days) only when they are stored at freezing temperature. In reality, because of the short duration of storage using the existing method, the fishing boat must return to the sea shore before the fishes caught become inedible. Therefore there is a need for improvised preservation methods like quick freezing which extends the storage time period without decaying of seafood. Cold storage by quick freezing methodology is an optimal way to achieve this.  ","This invention relates to a cold storage unit in trawler boat. In the existing IC engine and alternator is run and it produces 24 V D.C power. The produced D.C. power is stored in two batteries. The batteries are connected to an inverter, which changes the 24 V D.C. into 230 V A.C. power. The compressor is run by the power from inverter, which maintains the temperature of the storage tank for storing marine products. Through this invention we could minimize the running cost, maintenance cost, heavy initial investment in the preservation of fishes and moreover providing a safe storage. This invention is mainly concentrated on storage of fresh fish for a period more than 15 days. The storage of fresh fish may be carried out with the help of cold storage unit. Though the invention is explained with respect to fishing boat this invention will be useful in various applications such as automobiles, mobile units where in cooling or refrigeration is required. Therefore there is a need for improvised preservation methods like quick freezing which extends the storage time period without decaying of seafood. The refrigeration system thus maintains the temperature for preserving the fish by adopting the quick freezing method.","The prior invention was mainly concentrated on storage of fresh fish for a period of 7 to 15days.

A sensor circuit placed in the helmet of each miner will observe the environment changes and transmit 1310them to central control unit at radio frequencies. The factors considered during the development of this safety helmet are helmet 1310removal, exposure to hazardous gases and miners being hit by an object. The helmet removal is the first event considered where a miner has removed or neglected wearing a helmet. An IR sensor used in this helmet identifies if the helmet is on the miners head or not.The second event is the exposure to gases (air quality) where miners are exposed to harmful gases like carbon-di-oxide, 1310methane, sulfur-di-oxide during mining. A range of sensors are used to measure the air quality. Collision detection is considered 1310as the third event. This occurs when the miner is hit in the head by an object at a force that can lead to injury.1310A vibration sensor was used to measure the force causing the vibration of the head with which the HIC (Head injury 1310criteria) was calculated. A temperature sensor is also added because in case of any event there in a sudden change in temperature.It is advantageous to use LoRaWAN due to its remote environment monitoring capability. This is a cost effective, real time surveillance system with portability and accuracy that can avoid safety problems by early warning","The mining industry is a high safety risk due to problems like mine ventilation, danger from hazardous gases, incidents like rock fall and head injuries. These are direct threat to the safety of miners.

This idea of Hydration will be applied for suitable Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)","The innovation is using hybrid mode of energy source in which, the direct solar radiation as well as the heat recovery system from the kiln is used to dry the coconut chips inside the green house chamber. The heat generated inside the kiln is used to convert the coconut shells into charcoal (activated carbon) which becomes the additional product for the farmers to sell apart from coconut chips. The biomass used for burning in the kiln further helps to reduce the volume of biomass waste. Similarly, the charcoal manufactured from the kiln is highly required for boilers in industries and approximate Indiamart, Alibaba cost per kilogram is 48/-. Thus in turn dehydrated chips manufacturing made very easy for farmers and they can contribute modest increase in the income and livelihood of the farmer becoming an Entrepreneur.","The demand for dehydrated coconut chips increases day by day as it is branded as a healthy snack. India being the third largest producer of coconut in world with production capacity of 119,300,000 tonnes can become an attractive center for this market. Tamil Nadu with 31 of total production of the country can become a hub of export market. Various methods can be employed to dehydrate the coconut chips among which most of the farmers prefer open drying which consumes more time. To help the farmers by enhancing the production rate in shorter period of time, we propose a hybrid system in this work. In the proposed work, a hybrid greenhouse dryer with coconut shell kiln is developed inside which the raw coconuts are dehydrated. The temperature of the dehydration chamber will be maintained between 60? to 80? by using solar energy. During the absence of solar energy, coconut shells are heated in kiln, from which the flue gas is passed into the chamber through pipes to the dehydrate coconut chips. The heated coconut shells are converted as shell charcoal which has also value in world market. This gives dual monetary (Value added) benefit for a farmer. It is expected that the dehydrating rate can be improved by 60 than conventional open drying and dehydration is also enabled during off sun-shine hours by recovering waste heat from kiln. With high production of dehydrated coconut chips and shell charcoal at low cost, farmers can enjoy maximum monetary benefits through export.",The proposed idea will provide its benefits to the coconut farmers and the cluster of coconut farmers. The farmers who sell coconuts as a conventional product can add value to their product by converting the fresh coconut into coconut chips and the shells of the coconut into charcoal (activated carbon). The value added products has its huge potential of market in export to western countries (American and European countries).,"Product 1: Coconut Chips   The demand for nutritious and healthy snacks across the world is increasing rapidly. Apart from the market potential in India, the product can also be exported to European and American countries. Europe is a large importing region for desiccated coconut, accounting for a 30 share of the world? total imports, followed by the United States of America (10), Singapore (8), and the Russian Federation (4). European imports of desiccated coconut are relatively stable. European imports of desiccated coconut reached 118 thousand tonnes in 2020, worth ?211 million. However, a large share (26) of traded quantities is actually internal European trade. Direct imports from coconut-producing countries (all of which are developing countries) amounted to 85 thousand tonnes in 2020.    Product 2: Charcoal (Activated Carbon):   With depletion of fossil fuels at faster rate, the conventional small scale thermal power utilities are forced to shut down which were meeting the demand of electricity in localized area or in specific to an industry. The charcoal obtained from the coconut shell can be an alternate fuel for these small scale thermal power utilities to meet the demand of coal requirements.

When it comes to building autos, safety is top priority. As for as Indian road transport scenario concerned, accident are the major problems. The goal is to design and manufacture an automated pneumatic-based vehicle bumper system that uses a sensor in conjunction with pneumatic-operated bumper to prevent car dents and scratches. The vehicles frontal structure includes bumper and structural pieces that resist and limit damages caused by frontal collisions, as well as ensuring safety by absorbing the impact. This system guarantees passenger safety within the vehicle.  From old-fashioned lumber mills and coal mines to current machine shops and space robotics, pneumatics technology has grown in importance in the field of workplace rationalization and automation. As a result, technicians and engineers must have a thorough understanding of pneumatic systems, air actuated valves, and accessories.   The goal is to create and build an intelligent electronically controlled car bumper activation system named Automatic Pneumatic Bumper. The IR transmitter and receiver circuits, the control unit, and the pneumatic bumper system make up this system. The impediment is detected using the infrared sensor. If an impediment is within one foot of the vehicle, the control is passed to the safety bumper activation system. The guy and car are protected by a pneumatic safety bumper system. ","By monitoring temperature differences in the field of vision, infrared sensors may detect motion. It provides secured communication due to line of sight or point-to-point mode of communication. Infrared motion sensors detect motion in daytime and nighttime reliably. It is Quick responsiveness, low power consumption, From afar the operation is being carried out. The cost of replacement parts is low. Voltages of both DC and AC are supported. At both low and high temperatures, it can be used. - Flow control valves are used to maintain a steady flow rate that has been calibrated. These valves can be shut off with just a finger tight pressure due to the narrow aperture and strong force advantage. These valves also allow for precise adjustments, which helps with fluid flow control. - High Force and Quick Movement Pneumatic actuators may create a lot of force and move at a fast rate when used in linear motion control.","                  The failure to apply the brakes at the proper time is the primary cause of almost all vehicle accidents. Accidents can be avoided if brakes are deployed at the appropriate moment. When opposed to totally manual braking, automation can ensure greater brake dependability. The usage of a pneumatic system in automation can be beneficial owing to its simplicity and ease of use. As a result, the goal is to design and develop a system based on autonomous vehicle control in order to prevent road accidents and provide a safer driving experience.",During the projected period of 202282112029. the Automotive Bumper Market size is predicted to produce revenue and exponential market expansion at a spectacular CAGR.

With this rich human resource, India has to utilize the potential and generate Intellectual Properties to make India a self-sustained economy in the World and to be one of the powerful knowledge driven economies. In spite of rich young population, India secures 46th spot in Global Innovation Index. To improve the same and to make India a self-sustained economy, IP asset creation has to be improved which is very low in India. In 2020, the number of patents filed by Indian residents in India was around 22,000. During the same period the patent filing of China was approximately 13,50,000. At the same time, statistics makes us to understand that approximately 1 of every 3 applications is granted in India as well as in China. This gives us an understanding that the quality of applications is same in both countries, whereas the number of applications filed makes the difference.1310The core objective of IP Angaadi is to create awareness among small scale industries (MSMEs) and academia to create IP assets, help them in providing support to file and process IP assets of different forms (patents, copyrights, industrial designs, trademarks) and further to create an infrastructure to process IP assets within the organization and outside the organization by training human resources.","IP Angaadi focuses on two sectors for as target areas:13101.

2040,IDEATN005244,Shriram S,TAMIL NADU,VIRUDHUNAGAR,Implementing Aerial Delivery Service (Delivery via Drones),"Using only hand gestures and finger tip movement, computer mouse operations is performed using DL / AI algorithm.  ","The advancement of today8217s modern technologies with respect to its need for society has flourished to the top of the peak. From traditionally taking away food from restaurants, today we are opting for door-step delivery. The future for implementing drones for deliveries is not far away. It is just one innovation away. 13101310Our innovation, Aspir ADS (Aerial Delivery Service) promises to give guaranteed 15-minute delivery. The point to note here is, ADS does not rely on humans to deliver food/grocery/medicine. Since the entire delivery process is completely pre-programmed and automated, there is no need for the direct involvement of humans. The latest/newness of Aspir ADS while compared to other companies8217 tested prototypes are, our drones are processed by Flight Controlled Board (FCB)  Delivery Processing Unit (DPU) - The two chipsets combine to give a standard and fully autonomous control. Also, each drone will be provided with a Drone ID tag which will be used to monitor the drone8217s position and to control it remotely in case any unexpected situation arises. The drones will be trained on a standard delivery route first for a limited time before making it officially available to the public. After then, the drones tend to adapt and improvise from each delivery it makes.1310","While drone delivery sounds costlier, it actually costs lesser than traditional delivery methods. As per our expected stats, a regular delivery by drone should cost somewhere around ?45-?75. We are achieving this, first by making the drone entirely locally under Made In India scheme. Using parts made by local manufacturers for the drone not only reduces the production cost of drones but also encourages lots of UAV parts manufacturing companies to come forward. The main problem why several pioneers in this field cannot able to establish their path is, drone delivery is a concept that we know frighteningly little. The main objective here is, the entire drone delivery concept should be introduced in a slow split concept and not be available to all at the first time of launch itself. Our implementation idea is similar to a standard DTH connection that we use at our home. First, when we opt for a DTH connection, a technician will come and install the required receiver antenna and will explain the working of the DTH. Likewise, when the user from invite-only opts for drone delivery feature, he/she will be asked to pay a one-time charge for the installation of Drone Pad (Landing pad for Drone) after that the technician will explain all the details and how to use this feature properly. Since the landing zone for drones is fixed, it will be easier to access at ease.1310","The delivery drones have extensive applications from delivering foods, medicines, groceries, to delivering other light weighted goods in a shorter distance within a short span of time. Once delivery drones are implemented successfully, we can expect a drastic advancement in the UAV and Aviation field. Since drones are completely electric, they do not use any carbon-based fossil fuels. Every Drone Hub where drones will be operated will be equipped with solar sources to charge at least 50 of the available drones in that particular drone hub. Also, an increase in drone deliveries is inversely proportional to the reduction in standard roadway deliveries, This also affects reducing traffic jams. Implementing drone deliveries is not an immediate effect, But once implemented nationwide, our nation can place in the top 3 positions for the global UAV market. 1310","The drone delivery might sound costlier but it actually is not, like we already said. Standard delivery for food from the restaurant to the hotel will cost ?65 (approx. rate). Let us assume that we are implementing just 20 drones for a single city. A drone can do at least 2 deliveries in an hour minimum. And also, we will consider that a drone can function nearly 12 hours per day. Only from 20 drones operating in a single city, we can expect a revenue of ?31,200 (2/3rd of a drone8217s production cost covered in a single day) ?9,36,000 per month and around ?1.02 crores in a month revenue. If everything is going well and if we are implementing drones on large scale (once after people are familiar with drone deliveries and people welcome this feature) by implementing 400 drones operating across 25 cities, we can expect a revenue of ?12,48,000 per day and revenue of ?41,18,40,000 annually. While these figures seem practically impossible at first sight, this is literally possible once viewed from the right aspect. 13101310The drone delivery feature is not a new thing. But the thing that differentiates us from other companies is our look at the implementation and the details similar to this. We can not guess a proper date when all these might possible. But one day, this will be happening for sure and we hope our product will be serving lakhs of happy people across the nation.1310",Dr. Veerasamy,22,9751702400,A scaled prototype model has been made and sensor integration was going,One Year,"Healthcare & Life sciences, Medical Devices, Pharmaceuticals, Biotech, AYUSH and any related sub-sector"

Mainly in urban and metropolitan cities, we face a parking problem, and it becomes a major task to find parking spaces mainly at malls, multiplex, market, etc., It is more time and fuel consuming. Finding a parking space, it becomes a frustrating moment for a driver. If a driver does not find any parking space and they park anywhere in a roadside or a restricted area, then the traffic can occur, and the security of the vehicle becomes a major issue. To overcome this difficulty, it is very necessary to modernize the parking of commercial environment system. For designing advance parking slots one of the best solutions is to develop parking system with reservation of parking slot with the optimal parking space and minimized cost and time.It helps the user to find a parking space using a mobile application. Users can book a parking space in advance and can find the shortest way to reach a parking area using Mobile application and Bluetooth Beacons. Parking assistance is provided to find the users parked vehicle from the parking slot through the Mobile application and Bluetooth Beacons.They park a vehicle on their specific place and during exit users can pay a parking charge to depend on the time using a mobile application (e-payment). Users can do the payment using online transaction or RFID technology. It saves human time, money, and fuel and provides security to vehicles.","The methodology is a model to defined techniques or methods to develop, plan, and design a model or a project. This session explains about working of systems and applications with hardware and software that will be used for developing a system.The proposed system provides software in which a user can book a parking slot without any human assistance. In this android application the users can navigate and book the slots for parking. Initially the user has to login and register in the application. The users will be shown some preset slots and can select the slots according to the users wish. The already booked slots will not be shown. Voice based navigation is also provided.Here the user views the parking slot through the android application. User can book the slot after a user registration process. The user credentials will be stored to a database. Payment details and slot number will be sent to user after slot booking. User can use parking assistance if needed and park the vehicle. Once the user parks the vehicle, the timer starts. User can also locate the position of his/her parked vehicle through the application. The timer ends when the vehicle isremoved from the parking slot. Payment message is sent to the user and user can pay the amount using two methods: online transaction or by RFID tags. Payment confirmation is sent to the user. Implementation: The implementation of the proposed system contains two different stages. Software Implementation, Hardware Implementation. ","The technology includes components that consist of low-cost sensors, real-time data interference, and smart mobile applications that allow users to monitor available  unavailable parking spots.1310Facility to handle the parking of the vehicle suitably with the use of smart phones and development of infrastructure to support such mobility result in decrease in the amount of time spent by the user for finding out the vacant parking slot. Furthermore, some solutions facilitate the services, such as online payments, parking time notifications, and even car searching functionalities for very huge parking lots.1310","The global smart parking market was valued at 6.05 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach 11.13 billion by 2027. Smart parking is an intelligent parking system that assists drivers for safe parking. Available space in parking slot is indicted by sign or symbol with the help of embedded software and sensors. The vacant space is notified to the driver correctly due to the proper management of vehicle. This technology uses different types of sensors as a hardware component in the parking slot to detect presence or absence of the vehicles. Smart parking system provides real-time data information regarding the availability of nearby parking space and allows driver to accommodate that slot without any interference of other vehicles.1310Increase in parking concern across the globe, growth in demand for Internet of Things (IoT) based technology, and high adoption rate in number of vehicles drive the demand for global smart parking market. However, high employment cost  configuration complexity and low rate of internet penetration in developing regions restrain the market growth. 1310Moreover, rise in investment on building driverless vehicles and increase in government8217s initiative in building smart cities across the globe are expected to create tremendous opportunities for the growth of the market.

2072,IDEATN004422,Biju B,TAMIL NADU,KANNIYAKUMARI,MULTIFUNCTIONAL BABY CRADLE,No," First of all, there is only a cradle with swing motion. That is just initiated by motors. But our product doesn8217t only have the ability to swing but also it knows when to swing when to not and many more. Our product is noise less so that baby won8217t get disturbed by any noises. Our product can show the weight of the baby. It can be seen through a lcd screen which will be present in the cradle itself. The readings will also be saved in the database server and shown in your mobile app. So, you can see it from anywhere. The whole cradle can move smoothly with the controls from the app or anyone can push the cradle. There is also locking system which helps from preventing running of cradle in a slope area. Our device can sense urination from the baby and sends signal to the parents. The parents can record their voices in them and the AI uses them to calm the baby down while crying. The cradle is completely foldable at any time. It gives motion detection alarm if anything or anyone is passing nearby. The cradle will have camera to see the child and process that to know whether the child is happy or not. It has smoothing playlist to make the child feel better. If the child is placed in a room with high low temperature an alarm will be sent to parent8217s mobile. Our product helps parents to see the cradle from anywhere around the world. This cradle can be also used as a device to ensure safety in home. The cradle will have GPS trackers1310","Now a day8217s couple are busy with their work and don8217t have enough time with themselves.  At times like this a baby comes between them and make their life a litter harder.  At time like this the baby don8217t get enough care as much as it is needed. So, we are going to create a baby cradle which makes their job a little easier and more effective.13101310Objective:1310A good night sleep in silence with necessary care and good nutritious are the essential thing that are needed for a baby. In our project we are making a multifunctional electronic cradle for the baby which gives basic care to the baby by itself. The device will make the cradle swing so that the baby can sleep comfortably.  We use a urine alarming system in the cradle so that if the baby passes urine, it will send notification to the parents.  And there will be a camera in this cradle so the parents can check on their baby8217s condition form anywhere in the world at any time and real time. If by unfortunately the baby8217s having a fever or something like that which will rise the temperature in the body of the baby, then an alarm will be sent the parents.  If the surrounding of the baby is hot, we use a small air flow setup to normalize the temperature inside the cradle.  The parents can control most of the parts by using Arduino Chip on their own. ","The main purpose of this cradle is to help parenting simpler. The main potential area we use this technology is in home. All new parents need this machine to reduce their stress and increase their potential. If you remember at some point, you would get triggered by noise of child8217s cry. Thing of their parents then. Our cradle doesn8217t split parents from their child. It only increases the relationship. Our product can be used in many areas. The main area is in home. This helps the mother or father to do their jobs peacefully without always getting stressed of child8217s condition. Home will be the place where our product will have high sales. If you think why people are needed to buy this machine, its actually really necessary. Not every time anyone can watch the baby and not everyone can hire a babysitter. Babysitter actually reduces the relationship between parents and child. So, this would be an alternative idea to make the baby stay in cradle longer without crying. The Next place our product would show its power is in hospitals. Lot many hospitals have nursery where babies are kept. Our product can be used in that area. This helps less nurses to take care of babies. Less spread of infections among babies. Yeah it is true that touching babies often causes spread of diseases. So our cradle helps in hospitals. Next our electronic cradle can be used in orphanages. This actually also works as it is hard to manage many babies at a time. ","We use the baby cradle to keep the baby safe when we are not able to hold the baby in our own hands.  So we better make sure to buy the right one.  But what if there exit a cradle with multifunctional applications that can reduce lot of stress for the parents.  Well people you are in luck what we are marketing is a baby cradle that contains both crib and cradle at the same time.  And it contains lot of special characteristics, which will help the product to sell in India and foreign countries because there is no baby cradle that exist with our features.  We can easily sell our product in hospitals, couples who just had baby, orphanage and places like that.  By selling our product a single time apart from cost that was made we can make a profit up to 3,000 Rupees.  India and China are the largely populated area so they are our targeted place. 1310     Every day 67,385 babies are born in India that8217s 1/6th of the world.  So, if we sell at least 4000 cradle a day we can make a profit amount of 12,000,000 Rupees in one day.  With this cradle in home everybody is happy. This product will have a bright use in future as it will be vey hard to look out for child when there is jobs 24/7. This product can make a huge sale in marketing industry. 1310",1.

2081,IDEAPY003426,T. Anand,PUDUCHERRY,PONDICHERRY,Jackfruit based Vegan meet,NA,"Plant-based meat analogs are mimic products that look like animal meat, along with nutritional properties, beneficial health benefits, and sensory properties. The challenge is to achieve a one-factor optimization process that optimizes each selected component of the meat analog. The final basic ingredients of the meat analog would be selected and the developed product was sensorially evaluated using a 9-point hedonic scale. Young jackfruit has become a popular meat substitute because young fruits are unflavored and have a fibrous and fibrous texture that resembles meat. When cooked, it easily absorbs the flavors of other ingredients and becomes the basis for dishes similar to pulled pork and shredded chicken. Jackfruit plays an important role in the diet of the country in which it grows, as it is easy to grow and each tree is very productive. Many consider it an edible crop that may help alleviate hunger in other suitable tropical regions of the world. However, just because a food is plant-based does not mean that it is environmentally friendly food.","Plant-based meat substitutes (PBMA) have been debated for decades but have recently become one of the hottest topics in the food and research community. Plant-based (PBM) meat products incorporate the flavor, texture, and/or nutritional aspects of meat, but differ in composition. In other words, it is made from materials other than animals. Based on development time and technical complexity, PBM products can be divided into two flexible categories: traditional and new (ie, next-generation). Traditional meat analogs were developed in Asia thousands of years ago and contain relatively simple derivatives from soybeans (tofu, tempeh, etc.) or wheat (seitan, etc.). In contrast, the new PBM is an excellent product design and marketing alternative to ABM in terms of taste, texture, and nutritional value. Our goal is to introduce the potential of jackfruit by-products to develop healthy meat analogs. Meat analogs are made by varying the ratio of jackfruit by-products to wheat gluten. Examination of the texture properties of meat analogs has shown that as the wheat gluten content decreases, hardness and chewiness significantly reduce. Concerning sensory properties, meat analogs containing 58 jackfruit by-products and 20 important wheat gluten are the most in terms of appearance, aroma, flavor, color, hardness, juiciness, and overall acceptability. It was a preferred meat analog. ","A dietary shift to local plant-based organic foods has been proposed to address greenhouse gas production around the world, but without such intervention, GHG is predicted to increase from 30 to 40 by 2050. In addition, increasing the consumption of plant-based foods and reducing the consumption of animal-based foods can help address the climate crisis and improve overall health by reducing the risk of infectious and non-communicable diseases. Therefore, plant-based foods are rapidly gaining popularity among health-conscious consumers due to their unique nutritional properties and awareness of antibiotic abuse in livestock. To keep up with this growing consumer trend, plant-based food manufacturers and operators have increased the production of plant-based meats, milk, and eggs in recent years. According to Grand View Research (2019), the global plant-based meat market will reach the US  3.3 million in 2019 and is expected to grow by 19.4 annually from 2020 to 2027. For example, the size of the US plant-based meat market is projected by product. 2016-2027 (US  Million). Similarly, India has become the second fastest-growing plant-based meat market, accounting for 4.11 of total GDP. On the other hand, very few startups are using high-throughput technology to 3D print plant-based meat to resemble the texture of plant-based meat products as the original meat product. Plant-based meat substitutes/meat analogs are rapidly occupying the majority of consumers.","Increasing awareness of jackfruit immunity and nutritional value is a major growth driver for the global jackfruit market. In addition, increased production of jackfruit flavored products by key players is expected to boost future jackfruit market growth. Increasing the use of jackfruit as an alternative to vegan meat is expected to drive demand for products over the next few years. The distribution channel segment of supermarkets is expected to be the largest contributor to the overall jackfruit market as it is increasingly infiltrating developing countries such as India. We target both the global and Indian vegan food markets. Although many vegan alternatives are introduced in the market, there is a void of products that address the texture, taste, and consistency of Indian cuisine and importantly South-Indian. Our startup will focus on creating Indian meal cuisine-based meal kits, rather than burger patties or nuggets.","T.

Apps have been created to satisfy just about any need, from gaming to fitness, transport to live updates, shopping to socializing ·whatever you require is out there at the tap of a button. Along with this growing demand, comes the need to protect unique and inventive business ideas that have been realized in a material form.  However, before releasing an App, intellectual property considerations need to be taken into account. For an App to bring value, it needs to add to, and not detract from, a customer? experience to encourage the notional customer to use the feature as much as possible ·this, coupled with its brand name and logo, is the creative or innovative concept that needs protection.  As Geo Intellects Pvt. Ltd. has proposed the solution by developing a farmer-centric mobile application (app). Thus, all the three fields within the intellectual property that come into play when considering how best to protect the App may be implemented here.   These are:   a. Copyright: copyright protects the originality and creativity behind the App   b. Patents: Patents protect the invention behind the App and   c. Trademarks: Trademarks protect the name, logo, or other visual identifiers of an App.  ","Technological advancements in the agriculture sector meet the growing demand for farm automation, digitalization, and sustainability. Emerging agriculture trends mark a shift towards smart farming and efficient utilization of time and resources while reducing crop losses. Smart farming is an upcoming concept that deploys technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), computer vision, and artificial intelligence (AI) for farming. Robots and drones are replacing traditional farm operations such as picking fruits, killing weeds, or spraying water or fertilizer on crops. Imagery from drones and satellites, coupled with Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, provides a high-resolution and location-specific view of the field. Further, IoT devices, powered by sensor technology, collect real-time field data that allow farmers to make data-driven decisions. In addition, the widespread adoption of precision agriculture and indoor farming in recent years fuels IoT growth in farming. 1310The Smartphone mobile application which will be designed and developed by Geo Intellects Pvt. Ltd. is expected to be the most commonly used agriculture app in India. The mobile apps will be multilingual and these regional languages would be designed to break the literacy barrier and deliver the information in the simplest  user-friendly manner. The app would be helping the farmers starting from seed selection for their farm to that of the market potential of the scientifically grown crop.","The agriculture industry has radically transformed over the past 50 years. Advances in machinery have expanded the scale, speed, and productivity of farm equipment, leading to more efficient cultivation of more land. Seed, irrigation, and fertilizers also have vastly improved, helping farmers increase yields. Now, agriculture is in the early days of yet another revolution, at the heart of which lie data and connectivity. Artificial intelligence, analytics, connected sensors, and other emerging technologies like Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) could further increase yields, improve the efficiency of water and other inputs, and build sustainability and resilience across crop cultivation and animal husbandry.1310As per the latest reports, the demand for food is growing at the same time the supply side faces constraints in land and farming inputs. The world8217s population is on track to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, requiring a corresponding 70 percent increase in calories available for consumption. About one-quarter of arable land is degraded and needs significant restoration before it can again sustain crops at scale. And then there are increasing environmental pressures, such as climate change and the economic impact of catastrophic weather events, and social pressures, including the push for more ethical and sustainable farm practices, such as higher standards for farm-animal welfare and reduced use of chemicals and water.","To address these forces poised to further roil the industry, agriculture must embrace a digital transformation enabled by connectivity. Yet agriculture remains less digitized compared with many other industries globally. Past advances were mostly mechanical, in the form of more powerful and efficient machinery, and genetic, in the form of more productive seed and fertilizers. Now, much more sophisticated, digital tools are needed to deliver the next productivity leap. Some already exist to help farmers more efficiently and sustainably use resources, while more advanced ones are in development. These new technologies can upgrade decision-making, allowing better risk and variability management to optimize yields and improve economics. Deployed in animal husbandry, they can enhance the well-being of livestock, addressing the growing concerns over animal welfare.1310Today, mobile apps and services are being designed and released in different parts of the world. The USDA8217s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has released the first two of a suite of mobile phone apps known as 8216LandInfo8217 and 8216LandCover8217. Available to be downloaded from Google Play Store, they are currently for use on Android phones only.1310These apps connect agricultural producers around the world and provide them with shared knowledge on ways to maximize their land8217s productivity while protecting its resources for future generations.

There are no molds required. The use of an oven is optional. Less scrap resulting from trapped air bubbles. Overbuild waste is greatly reduced. Considerably less labor required. Short turn-around time. Lower production costs.,"Through this process a ribbon of liquid urethane is applied to a rotating roller and moved across the cylindrical surface. The method is somewhat similar to turning, but the material is applied instead of being removed. It is possible to build layers to different thicknesses for subsequent machining to accurate dimensions. Rollers can be coated with several hundred kilograms of polyurethane. This is a fast and efficient method for coating large or small rollers for use in demanding applications. In this process, material is pumped through a metering machine to a traversing mix head that deposits the mixed material onto a rotating steel shaft. Depending upon the required thickness, one or more mix head passes might be required to obtain the correct build. Once applied, the polyurethane will achieve a final cure at room temperature.","All the PU Roller manufacturer who makes the roller for Steel Industry, Paper Industry, Printing Industry as well as other Industrial application rollers ( Woven Sack Industry etc) .

The questions are also added for various difficulty levels so that as soon admin chooses the type of paper difficulty (Easy, medium, difficult) the system automatically generates paper. 1310This feature of this software makes it unique because till now Teacher use to set the question paper either manually or through Google forms, whats app and many more apps to generate question papers but all these feature did not meet the requirement of teachers and also not able to minimize  simplify the process.","The idea behind the QGEN came during covid period when we saw teachers facing the challenge of generating question papers.

We talked to the teachers of different schools and institutions regarding preparation of question papers. These problem give us an idea of QGEN, which stands for question generator. We thought that there must be a system that is capable of generating question paper with the following constraints: Stick to question paper structure viz. imaging question paper in which no of very short question carrying specific marks, nos of short type question carrying specific marks, nos of long type question carrying specific marks.Stick to the defined syllabus for each exam viz. weight age of each chapter. Difficulty level (percentage of easy, medium  hard questions including HOTs).Objectives: Overcome the constraints which are mentioned above. Make setting question papers for any exam is simple.

As a counter measure to this we are trying to design and develop a SWH embedded with thermal energy reservoir (PCMs) for heating during dawn and adverse climate condition. To enhance the overall efficiency of the heating system nano particles will be used with the PCMs as nanocomposite thermal energy reservoir.   ,"Solar water heating works on the mechanism of utilizing the solar radiation for water heating using a solar absorbing collector plate. Solar radiations are used to heat up the water in solar water heater assembled with a solar absorber thermal collector plate. The performance and efficiency of solar water heater depends on various parameters such as design specifications, thickness, insulating materials, pipe material intended for circulation of water, number of channels and type of reflector, spacing between absorber etc. With the intention to enhance its performance and efficiency, a thermal energy reservoir has been widely used. It not only improves the performance but also ensures the availability of warm water during night. Paraffin wax as a Phase change material (PCM) has been extensively used in the form of thermal energy reservoir because throughout its melting process it8217s having high energy storage density along with a defined operating temperature. PCM are most extensively used in the applications of energy conversation in buildings, solar air heater, solar cooler, thermal insulation, green houses and textiles. Among the various PCMs investigated, paraffin has been used basically as latent heat energy storage reservoir because it possesses large latent heat and has got stable thermal characteristics. Paraffin wax have limited ensure cooling, low vapour pressure, good thermal and chemical stability. ","Researchers have stated in their research that about 35.3 of the total global energy is used in the residential and commercial purposes. In 35.3, about 75 of energy is exploited only to warm the water and also for heating room. Latent heat storage is a comparatively new field of research for advancement of energy management and utilization of renewable energy.

Our Novel contribution includes a combination of transmitted and reflected NIR signals to increase the accuracy of the device. As the absorption of the NIR signal increases with the increase in wavelength but faces decreases in skin penetration depth, so lower NIR signal is used to obtain transmitted data and higher NIR signal is used for reflected data. The combined transmitted NIR signal of 660nm and 940 nm will be used for SPO2 estimation and other three NIR signal from 940nm,1050nm,1300nm will be used for BG estimation. The data samples will be collected from prediabetic, diabetic and healthy subjects by following proper medical protocols. A Cluster based regression model and ANN regression model is proposed to increase the efficiency of the device. The developed product will be based on Internet of Things (IOT) framework using Raspberry Pi Zero (RPi) energised with a power bank for smart healthcare monitoring","Concept: The NIR spectroscopy is based on the vibrational characteristics of the bonding atom under the application of a specific wavelength. The molecules absorb the light energy at its resonant wavelength and start vibrating. The change in the intensity of the transmitted and reflected light wave with respect to the incident light wave is used to identify and estimate the concentration of the molecule. The Glucose molecule(C6H12 O11)  contains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms. These bonding atoms shows stretching at a specific wavelength in the NIR region, and these characteristics are used to identify the glucose molecule.1310Objective: The objective of the project is to develop a single non-invasive, pain-free, low-cost IoT-based framework device for providing smart-health care facilities, especially in rural areas. The device will be able to timely monitor the BG and SPO2 level and store data in the cloud that endocrinologists can access. It will help in providing timely proper health treatment and reducing the risk of severe diseases.","The developed product will be very much useful for medical applications in smart-health care monitoring. The Low cost and battery-operated IoT based framework make it reliable in a rural area having limited health care centres. The increase in the blood glucose level leads to several health issues like depression, brain dysfunction, eye problem, kidney problem, cardiovascular diseases and increases the probability of death almost 50 higher in comparison to the patients without diabetes. The chances of the mortality rate of diabetics can be reduced by timely monitoring of the blood glucose level. The presently used glucose monitoring system uses blood samples for measurement. These are an invasive technique that requires puncturing of the skin for a blood sample. The accuracy of the invasive technique is high, but in the case of a regular check-up, became painful for the patient and also increases the risk of infection The pain-free monitoring of Glucose and Oxygen level will be very helpful for the diabetics patients who require frequent monitoring","According to the survey of Data Bridge Market Research, the market size of Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Devices was valued at USD 14.15 Million in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 124.17 Million by 2028.

2106,IDEAJH003220,Sangeeta Kumari,JHARKHAND,SARAIKELA KHARSAWAN,Evaluation of Recharge Potentials and Groundwater Sustainability under Changing Climate using GIS techniques and GCM,NO,"Since the groundwater recharge potentials are highly influenced by several environmental factors such as excessive exploitations, climate change, urbanization, change in land use and land cover, advanced techniques such as GIS and remote sensing using high resolution remote sensing data such as gridded rainfall, soil moistures, land cover etc. are required for mapping the recharge potentials on a regional scale. The sustainability of the groundwater recharges must be calculated for the recharge potential zones. The fluctuations of the water table must be observed for estimation of the actual groundwater recharge. The impacts of the climate change are found quite effective on recharge potentials zones that need to be address by downscaling of projected General Circular Model variables such as precipitations and temperature on a regional scale through an advanced downscaled technique. Thus, the proposed study motivated towards developing GIS based models for estimating ground water recharge potentials and its sustainability under changing climate system.  ","The objective of this study is to evaluate the recharge potentials and groundwater sustainability at water stress regions that help in finding favorable sites for artificial recharge. For this, a geospatial framework is needed to generating and organizing the data layers such as digital surface elevation, land-use and land cover, soil type, soil depth and texture, lithology, geomorphology, rainfalls, runoff, evapotranspiration. Recharge potentials sites will be identified by integrating the data layers using index overlay method and multi-criteria decision making techniques. The spatial and temporal variation of rainfall in the study area can be included using high resolution gridded daily rainfall data of 0.25x0.25 deg. The volume of surface water available for daily recharge is calculated by subtracting daily runoff and daily evapotranspiration from the daily rainfall. The results may be validated with actual ground water level fluctuation data. GCM based climate models such as CMIP5 may be used for projecting rainfalls and dynamic downscaling method would be used to downscale the rainfall on regional scale. The impacts of the climate change on recharge potentials will be analyzed.

In the summer season, there is a need to have AC in other rooms too, but everyone cannot afford it. Therefore, let design indoor unit with two-sided air guiders. The air guider of the indoor unit can be designed to operate through either side (at a time only one side is operational) so that unaffordable expense can be avoided as majority of populations can not afford AC in every room. With little design modification, the indoor unit can be shared in two room having common wall one after one by controlling air guider automatically controlled by sensor to let flow of air in both sides. When the room gets cooled, the air guider will be closed. Subsequently, the other room side guider will be opened, hence the adjacent room can be cooled. With this concept, electricity consumption can also be reduced. ","With little modification in the design of the indoor unit, extra and unaffordable expenses can be avoided. This is very effective for those people, who can afford only one AC. In such a situation, one can buy an AC and if you are sitting in another room then you do not need to install AC there.

It gives a huge opportunity for Agrivate to scale at the national and also international levels. ","The low productivity in the agriculture sector is the result of various structural challenges, including heavy dependence on rainwater for irrigation, small-farm land holdings, and lack of access to technology and real-time information. Around 70 of the agricultural households in India (mostly small farmers with average landholdings of less than one hectare) struggle to make ends meet and depend on loans for their farming activities.13101310The demand for food in India is growing. That trend is likely to continue as disposable incomes increase and changes in consumption patterns favor value-added foods. However, supply is constrained by marginal productivity gains in a majority of crops, the shrinking amount of arable land, erratic monsoon patterns, climate change effects, and inherent supply chain inefficiencies that lead to waste. The reduction of available labor in the agricultural field makes the situation worse.13101310Given the importance of agriculture in India, this is where Agrivate is working to improve the effciency and productivity of Indian agriculture and exploring how Farming as a Service (FaaS) solutions can play a role.

Plant Tissue culture is a technique of growing plant cells, tissue, organ, seeds, or other plant parts in sterile environment on a nutrient medium. Plant tissue culture is widely used to produce clones of a plant known as    in vitro ·micro propagation  ","As every person is different and unique, so is each plant. Some have traits like better color, yeild or pest resistance. For years, scientists have looked for methods to allow them to make exact copies of these superior individuals. Many of us think that all plants grow from seeds. However, researchers have now developed several methods of growing exact copies of plants without seeds. And they are now doing this through a method called tissue culture. Tissue culture(TC) is the cultivation of plant cells, tissues or organs on specially formulated nutrient media. Tissue culture is seen as an important technology for developing countries for the production of disease-free, high quality planting material and the rapid production of many uniform plants. Micro propagation increases the amount of plantig material to facilitate distribution and large scale planting.

With the current state of technology, services such as lighting, battery charging, irrigation, refrigeration, and others can be provided not only for private use but for income generation (World Bank, 2019), and a reliable and sustainable energy supply is the fundamental first step in this process. Substantial development in PV technology, storage, and power electronics has boosted competitive microgrid design and development in many rural areas. These autonomous energy systems integrate solar, wind, and back-up diesel generation along with battery storage and energy management constitute the best solution to the energy supply challenge for remote communities.  This kind of project will elevate social revenue but for communities to improve and reach the goal of sustainable development, it is imperative to exceed the minimum power requirements that small isolated renewable energy systems have usually provided so that the productive use of energy can be promoted. ","Renewable energy (RE), which is more environmentally sustainable, abundant and commercially viable, has become a focal point of concern as an alternative power source to conventional fossil and other energy sources. In several countries, tariffs and photovoltaic solar (PV) systems are actively marketed, making them one of the most quickly expanding RE sources that can be introduced into the grid delivery network. This work aims to provide the three-phase power grid feeding non-linear load with a micro grid (?-grid) integrating the wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) resource along with Battery Energy Storage (BES). A new topology is proposed with a distributed hybrid generator based on a permanent synchronous photovoltaic and wind driven magnet.

The 3D printing process can also be termed additive manufacturing or rapid prototyping. 3D printing constructs a three-dimensional object from a CAD or 3D digital model. A 3D printer fabricates parts with various internal infill densities and various structures. Currently, different types of 3D printers (plastic, resin, polymer, ink, and powder (metal or polymer)) are all available on the market.1310The main aim is to develop the direct injection of solvent (liquid) from top to bottom in a flow-based 3D printer for multiple applications in research laboratories. During the research experiments in laboratories, many solutions and solvents will be prepared. There is no proper 3D printer for use of these solutions and solvents. Most of the 3D printer8217s materials have to be purchased from commercial zones or markets. Instantly making or producing material (solutions and solvents) in laboratories, it can8217t be used in 3D printers. So there is a need for the printer to obtain quick printing methods with prepared material (solutions and solvents). In the proposed project, the developing 3D printer will be setup as a liquid flow chamber (top to bottom flow) and with a combination setup of fused deposition model. Further, the bed plate will be developed with a length of 75 cm width of 75 cm X height of 75 cm and can be printed in all three directions (X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis).  ","The developing 3D printer will be based on the new concept of top-to-bottom liquid flow and the parallel combination setup of FDM. Figure 2 (in uploaded copy) shows the highlighted red portion will be a heating coil for the printer to melt the polymer and solvents. The base plate will be constructed and fabricated using ceramic or acyclic material. In the printer, the base plate will be 75 cm X Y-axis 75 cm (lxb). Furthermore, in the Z-axis, the printer can also be moved up and down 75 cm with the help of a stepper motors. Currently, in the trend, some of the 3D printers that are available in markets are fused deposition models (FDM), stereo lithography (SLA), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Digital Light Process (DLP), Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), and Multi Jet Fusion (MJF).

The majority of 3D printing occurs in foreign countries and is marketed to India, but 3D printed markets are emerging in India as well. So, this new concept can be helpful in many ways. The 3D printing process can also be termed additive manufacturing or rapid prototyping. 3D printing constructs a three-dimensional object from a CAD or 3D digital model. A 3D printer fabricates parts with various internal infill densities and various structures. Currently, different types of 3D printers (plastic, resin, polymer, ink, and powder (metal or polymer)) are all available on the market. 3D printer production offers an additional advantage when compared with traditional instruments and equipment. These printers do not have liquid and solvent-based methods for printing ability. Thus, there is a need for liquid-based printers for quick printing. 3D printers help with printing in all areas, such as quick manufacturing, no material waste, time savings, cost effectiveness, and a good manufacturing process. Support for 3D printers in industries such as mechanical, civil, jewelry, and toys. In the applications of education, prototype and manufacturing, medicine, construction, art and jewelry.

","Once this 3D liquid (top-bottom) and fused deposition model printer is ready, it will be released to the commercial market. The price of the developing 3D printer will be less than (Rs. 50,000/-) fifty thousand. In the market, the majority of 3D printer cost more than 2.5 lakhs. 3D printing in educational fields has a wide variety of important uses in primary and secondary schools, universities, libraries, technical colleges, and other educational settings. 3D printing has changed the manufacturing world for the better. Many manufacturers use 3D printing and additive manufacturing technologies to produce aeroplane parts, prosthetic limbs, and even 3D-printed medications. In education, 3D printing technologies facilitate improved learning, skills development, and increased student and teacher engagement with the subject matter.13103D printing reduces the time and determination of the manufacturer, scientists, and researchers in creating a prototype, much more emphasis can be put on research and design of a product. Moreover, many industries, like defence and others that use critical components that require testing, can use this 3D printing technology to create a working prototype of the component. Due to the high degree of accuracy and precision, one can print even the slightest of variations neatly.

This cluster contributes around INR 225 crores per annum 1310Target Market:1310?9Household community,Cooking industry (Eateries)1310 We consider the above mentioned communities as our potential customers. We are exploring all the possibilities to enhance customer satisfaction and services as well. ","The currently available wet grinders demand a lot of manual assistance from the user which in turn makes the battering process absolutely tedious and time-consuming. In contrast to the existing grinding machines, the proposed solution stands unique by providing a complete automated experience to the user. 13109Also, the user can interact with the proposed smart grinder through the touch interface which is mounted on the machine8217s surface. Consequently, the UI (User Interface) enables the user to customize the grinding speed, if required and it also provides relevant information such as status of process, water content and so on. The integration of IoT with the smart grinder helps in prompting the user about the completion of the grinding process and also alerts in case of any problems such as overheating, if any. Since, RUL (Remaining Useful Life) is estimated the user will be prompted timely to service the machine, if required.1310Competitor Landscape:1310?9Panasonic Wet Grinders.?9Sri Lakshmi Industries ?9Premier Wet Grinders ?9Elgi Ultra Wet Grinders ?9Sowbaghya Wet Grinders1310?9Butterfly Wet Grinders ?9Bajaj Industries13109With numerous competitors, our product will provide a complete automated experience to the end-users in contrast to the existing grinding machines in the global market.

The wild animals invade to the human living areas it is some of the biggest threats to human life and Animals. This conflict has leads to Economic losses and also immeasurable loss of crops, livestock and property which leads to the reduction of numerous species and an uncountable human death.1310We took this solution for above problem with our new innovation idea with drone setup. We had three features in our drone one is to inject the anesthesia using air compressor gun and the second is to distract the wildlife using the ultrasonic speaker and third is to spray the anesthesia through Nozzle which is located below the brushless motor. And our method is the unique opportunity to save the human life from the wildlife and vice versa.1310UNIQUENESS:1310We had some specification in our drone like,131082269Air Compressor Gun131082269Ultrasonic Speaker131082269Anesthesia Sprayer","If the animal had been found in any rural area, we will make this drone to fly and identify the animal with the help of camera and we can shoot them with the help of air compressor gun and incase the animals are hidden in anywhere we can make the sound with the help of ultrasonic speaker and we can distract the animals and then we can fire, if the injection had been missed magazine can automatically reload using servo motor, it contains 6 bullets. And when it gets triggered, the animal will get faint and we can easily take that animal into the gaze and if there are more wildlife means we can use the nozzle spray method and we can easily capture the animals without any violence.1310Air compressor gun is placed below the drone by using air compressor motor absorbing the atmospheric air and passes that air to the two cylindrical air chambers and by using pipe sending the saved air from the chamber to the air relief valve. When air valve opens air passes to the suppressors and from the suppressor inject will be ejected what we are aiming. By using the ultrasonic speaker produce the sound and certain frequency which will distract them. The speaker is placed in front of two cylindrical air chamber. Frequency ranges from 22khz. By using the transmitter, we can easily operate the drone in anywhere and we can easily stabilize the balance the drone when it gets fired. Below the Brushless motor we have nozzle to spray anesthesia if the animal were in a crew.","This method can be used to record the daily activities of wildlife in the forest and this can reduce the overwork of forest officials by using this idea we can reduce the risk and work of rescue team and I hope that our idea will be more effective our motive is to save animals from humans and humans from animals by using our drone.1310If the animal had been found in any rural area, we will make this drone to fly and identify the animal with the help of camera and we can shoot them with the help of air compressor gun and incase the animals are hidden in anywhere we can make the sound with the help of ultrasonic speaker and we can distract the animals and then we can fire, if the injection had been missed magazine can automatically reload using servo motor, it contains 6 bullets. And when it gets triggered, the animal will get faint and we can easily take that animal into the gaze and if there are more wildlife means we can use the nozzle spray method and we can easily capture the animals without any violence.","Market potential of our idea is start with the Innovative idea and we should take research on our idea and analyses the project. if the idea is not effective, we should take another new idea.

Currently the waste water is released into the sewers and then released into the nearby water bodies mostly untreated. There are 234 sewage treatment plants in India but concentrated only to just 5 percent of the cities that are situated near water bodies. The waste water from the rest of the cities is dumped without any proper treatment. Domestic waste water comprises of 70 percent of the sewage water. So, treating it at home and making it available for reuse can solve 90 percent of the problem. This process will decentralize the sewage treatment system and reduce the load on treatment plants. This will also solve the problem of water scarcity. The proposed solution incorporates the use of stone, sand, charcoal (to filter out the solid particles, pathogens, toxins and to remove bad odor and taste) and wetland plants (to remove nitrogen, phosphorous, organic chemicals and to fix the chemical oxygen demand of the water) to purify the water.

A tank of 1.6m length, 0.5m width and 1m height could purify about 350 liters in 24 hours. The system wont take much space compared to its capability which makes it suitable for homes. It can provide a supply of good water for domestic purposes at low cost. Also, the plant filter is like a floating garden which will add to the beauty of our home and make our homes a green home.","A system that can filter about 100 liters in 24 hours would cost only about 6000 rupees to install. This system will reduce our water bill to a great extent and solve water scarcity in many areas. Also, Vermicast, the product of earthworm cultivation costs at rupees 250 a kilo. The solid waste has to be collected from each home and the cultivation has to be done in a centralized manner. This will produce a great income with less effort because earthworm cultivation is an easy process. Also, this system will be of great use to homes in urban areas and apartments. They will get clean water at a very low investment and the system do not require much maintenance which makes it effective for usage at homes",Mr. R.RATHISH   Assistant Professor  Department of Mechanical Engineering  Sri Krishna College of Technology  Coimbatore 641042,"M.E., (Ph.D.,) , 8 years",Phone: 9500652530  Email: r.rathish(at)skct.edu.in,A prototype was developed for the proposed project and tested.

2190,IDEATN004957,Baranikumar Venugopal,TAMIL NADU,COIMBATORE,EXTRACTION OF CELLULOSE FROM BANANA SHEATH FIBRES,"The Idea doesnt involves any intellectual property, It is the common chemical process of nuterlization ,centrifugation and filtration. ","India is the leading producer of banana , after farmers harvesting the crop, it is burnt and causes environmental pollution, The project provides solution to effective management of biomass from the plant and generates lot of job opportunity also it works not only on survival but also the prosperity of farmers, The banana stem of 60 kg per plant is collected from the farmer and fiber is extracted then cellulose is produced, the uniqueness of the project is it doesnt harm environment and protects from pollution causing trouble to the eco system and the ozone layer. Here waste is converted to money for farmer which makes them to prosper and enriching their livelihoods.","The problems belong to agro industry, banana is majorly cultivated through the year in India, with annual production of 16.91 million tons. 1 banana plant releases 60 kg of biomass, most of the biomass are being dumped and burnt with causes environmental pollution. The industry is strategically located in between kulithalai and manaparai in Tamilnadu where banana production is very high in those areas.  In the region of kulithalai in Tamilnadu varieties like poovan and karpuravalli are harvested through the year. Leads to lot of biomass in that region. Integrating with Thottiyam banana growers federation (FPO), we collect the banana stem of 60kg approx. per plant, The plant is transported to the factory to produced cellulose which is major raw material in pharma, textile, paper and pulp and other chemical industries etc., we all so focus to export cellulose various country and boost the foreign trade which decreases that trade deficit ratio their by making India as a developed and bio mass managed country by implementing project we can provide employment to local people which leads to production of more jobs and to enrich rural empowerment.  While producing cellulose we also get potassium as a by product which we are importing many countries leads to trade deficit ratio, it is possible to sell the potassium in local areas which can reduce the trade deficit ratio and improves in Indian economy also we can market this potassium to FPO at  subsidiaries price.  ","The cellulose market is segmented into commodity cellulose pulp, cellulose fibers, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, microcrystalline cellulose, nanocellulose, and others, on the basis of derivative type. Amongst these, commodity cellulose pulp accounts for the largest market share owing to its significant application in the paper  pulp industry. The increasing use of commodity cellulose pulp in the manufacture of fluff for the textile industry is increasing the demand for cellulose.  Cellulose fibers are primarily used in the manufacture of textiles. On the other hand, they are used in the production of dietary fibers and thus find applications in the food industry. Cellulose fibers have excellent insulation properties along with a considerable mechanical strength, making them suitable for usage in the construction of walls and roofs. Other industries, such as paper  pulp, chemical synthesis, and pharmaceuticals also use cellulose fibers for multiple applications. The ongoing trend in the end-use industries to replace synthetic fibers to cellulosic fibers is expected to boost the growth of the cellulose market. The family of cellulose ethers consists of members such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), methylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), and their derivatives. Cellulose ethers form gel-like consistency when mixed with water due to its emulsification properties, which makes them suitable for application in food.","The global cellulose market size was USD 219.53 billion in 2018 and is projected to reach USD 305.08 billion by 2026, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.2 during the forecast period.  Cellulose is a linear-structured polymer consisting of thousands of glucose monomers joint at ?-1,4 linkages. It is the most abundant solid material on earth, as it is the main component in wood (40-45) and other plant-based materials (up to 90). Cellulose is primarily sourced from wood, cotton, flax, hemp, and jute. The inherent properties of cellulose include good mechanical performance, hydrophile, and hygroscopic nature. Cellulose is either used as pulp or as a derivative. The pulp is majorly used in the manufacture of paper and fluff material for sanitary pads and diapers. The key derivatives of cellulose, such as cellulose fibers, cellulose esters, cellulose ethers, and microcrystalline cellulose, are used across various end-use industries, in which they perform multiple roles.  Recent advancements in fabrication technologies, recyclability, and widening end-use opportunities have given cellulose market a boost. In the upcoming years, the importance of cellulose will scale up with end-use industries reorienting from petroleum-based products to sustainable resources for raw materials. This reorientation by the end-use industries is expected to have a positive effect on the cellulose market. Cellulose  cellulose derivatives manufacturers are focusing on sustainable differentiation in their products.",Mr.R.Ramesh  Assistant Professor  Department of Civil Engineering  Sri Krishna College of Technology  Coimbatore 641042.,6 years and M.E,Email: ramesh.r(at)skct.edu.in  Phone: 9500277757,"The project is in the final stage of tremendous RD, the quality of the sample is tested and input has been collected, the further idea is to implement the project and produce high-quality cellulose for the pharmaceutical and food industry.","The estimated time of completion of the idea would take around 8 months i.e by the end of 2022, the contract should be signed between FPO, erection should take place, inventory has to be planned, apt location to be chosen, clearance from state pollution control board, EB connection arrangements, etc.. to set up the plant.

For this we are using a website where travellers can book their entry pass. The app/website will be a user friendly easily understandable one, where the user only needs to provide with the ticket details and a photo. In this app they can book their E-tickets and pay using any methods including UPI. The user will be provided with an E-ticket with their photo and a QR code. This data will be transferred to the cultural site cloud server and when the user is at the site using the help of a camera the person is identified with help of the photo they provided at the time of booking. in case the photo doesn8217t match we go with the QR code given to them and ensures a contactless safe entry to the monument/site.

For that we use a website where the user can select their desired destination, place, date and time. The user can see the dates where more crowd is expected and the dates where the tickets are sold out. User can select their preferred date and time. Next the user is asked to fill their information and provide with Passport or Aadhaar no. for authentication. Then they have to pay the ticket fair in the website itself, so that there is no need for the user to go to the ticket counter at the destination. Next, they have to upload a recent picture of them, this will be used for face recognition at the destination. Then the user is provided with an E-Ticket with their photo and a QR code which include all their information. The user can download the ticket. When the user come to the site at the entrance there will be a camera the user is asked to show their face and the QR code to the camera. The camera will verify the user by comparing it with the information given at the time of booking. Once verified the user can enter into the destination.

2204,IDEATN003200,Shinduja Vetriselvan,TAMIL NADU,THENI,NECTARIA- Development of Soft Drink Incorporated with Betel and Sarsaparilla Extracts,"No, it does not involve use of existing intellectual property. It adapts new modern technology with Unique Ingredient which poses ancient medicinal practices","Soft drinks, in general, have negligible nutritional value, but it has a large amount of sugar incorporated. Sugar-sweetened beverages accounted for every 1 in 200 deaths caused by India8217s rising tide of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. In order to bring a full stop to this epidemic a natural zero-calorie soft drink named Nectaria was developed. The uniqueness of this innovation is 1. The sugar content of the Nectaria is completely replaced by stevia which is a natural zero caloric sweetener and does not have any known harmful side effects for human consumption. 2. Apart from the above said advantage Nectaria also contains betel leaf and sarsaparilla root extracts which possess medicinal properties such as anti-diabetic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-diuretic, and indigestion preventive.","A national survey report estimated that 72million adult population of India have diabetics. Niti-Aayog recently mentioned in a report that the incidences of overweight and obesity are increasing among children, adolescents, and women in India. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) 2019-2020, the percentage of obese women increased to 24 from 20.6 in 2015-16. While the percentage for men rose to 22.9. Lifestyle changes and daily dietary habit is the primary cause of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and related ailments. So there is an emerging need for alternative dietary plans which is not only diabetic friendly but also diabetic preventive. Nowadays, soft drinks, packed fruit juices, and milk-based beverages have an irreplaceable position in our day-to-day life. The majority of these drinks have negligible nutritional value, but it has a large amount of sugar incorporated. So there is an urgent need to replace these drinks with nutritional properties and zero-sugar yet tasty and refreshing drinks. The government of India recently proposed an additional tax on foods that are high in sugar, fat, and salt to tackle the rising obesity problem in the country. The main objective of the Nectaria is in-line with the Government of India8217s efforts to replace/reduce the consumption of existing sugary beverages.  ","Right now, there is no specific soft drink that is incorporated with an ingredient that possess anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-diuretic, and indigestion preventive property in the market. Nectaria is also suitable for all age groups and ethnic groups. It is extremely beneficial for diabetic, pre-diabetic, people with gastric problems, and health-conscious people. It can be marketed as a soft drink with therapeutic properties.","The traditional non-alcoholic beverages market has been facing a lot of challenges due to a decline in the demand for traditional carbonated soft drinks due to loaded sugar and artificial sweeteners, lack of skilled workforce, and huge capital costs. Consumers changing preferences, coupled with innovations in product packaging and sizing to improve affordability, have led to a rise in the consumption of non-alcoholic beverages in the country. In terms of revenue, the non-alcoholic beverages market in India was valued at INR 336.50 billion in FY 2020. It is expected to reach INR 1,131.52 billion by FY 2027, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.69 during the forecast period. Nectaria is applicable to the entire beverage market in India. It is formulated based on shifting consumer preferences.

The technique that we use is the ?ear-Infrared Laser Diode Spectroscopy·which calculates the no of glucose molecules at the sample spot when the laser is passed through the skin. On the basis of no of molecules at the sample spot, the glucose levels of the patient is calculated with the specified formula. The prototype is of the hand patch type, which helps the patient to carry it easily. The data of the user is sent to the registered account time to time and the user is notified with his levels and condition. Our application will also help the user about his daily diet, physical activity, description and availability of prescribed medicines and connections with his family and personal doctors.","The objective behind the idea is to make the glucose test easier for diabetics with the use of a non-invasive NIR Spectroscopy technique that is pain-free and handy to use. The device helps diabetics check their levels daily and take suggested precautions to lead a healthy life by connecting with doctors and family members on the application. As there are glucometers available in the market and there is research going on in this particular technique, we aim to build the device with maximum accuracy and cost-effectiveness which can be affordable for any category of people.","The potential areas of application in the industry/market are the hospitals. As there will be the maximum count of patients visiting the hospitals for the check-ups, the doctors may guide the patients to use glucometers and bring awareness among the patients.1310And also there are situations where the glucose levels, blood pressure levels of the patient need to be checked to perform the surgeries. There are scenarios where the patient8217s condition becomes abnormal in the middle of surgery even though it is normal at the start. This makes the patient condition critical and chances of surgery implementation may be less. So, listing the levels of the patients all the time during the surgery and notifying the surgeons about their condition helps the surgery to go well by taking the necessary precautions.","As per the stats, the number of diabetic deaths is increasing across the world. By 2045, there is a chance of a drastic increase in the deaths of diabetics. To avoid the serious and unexpected deaths of diabetic patients due to the abnormality in their health, the use of glucose monitors is being increased as per the time being.

Our innovative idea is to make many  low cost buoys  and deploy them to create a network of ocean data collection infrastructure  that can serve anyone who participates in the maritime market . Data always helps people , the more cost effective and accurate it is the better . We are trying to provide the masses with no less . We are trying to solve the issue with having very less or no live information about our Coastlines . We want to help avert disasters , and increase productivity of all individuals at sea by providing them with all kinds of information. We can even detect ocean currents more accurately than anyone with such a network live . Our application is a strong attempt at  solving  an age old problems of the lack of data about mother nature  .","Our Goal is to increase the chances of gaining  higher yields for local fishing business  by providing them with crucial data related to ocean currents, ocean weather, location of fish clusters or density of fish numbers  as per regions. We will be also providing all kinds of other data like ocean tectonic activity, ocean temperatures, measurement of waves etc. We will do this by deploying hundreds of buoys near areas of interest, or places with high fishing activity, this would eventually grow to cover all our Indian beaches. These buoys are multipurpose, although their focus will be on providing data to help fishermen, the same data can be used by various institutions, companies, small and medium businesses who operate near the Seas. Our objectives include  providing this service with lower costs and higher accuracy. As for our concept, we will be retrofitting  all the buoys that we deploy with several sensors, underwater and above to gather all kinds of data. We will be using 2d mapping techniques density of number of  fish etc . We will be using low cost 32 bit processors to control all these sensors, accumulate the data  and  send this information to a server where the data will be processed and shown live. After deploying hundreds of these buoys, we will effectively  have a network  effect with all these buoys operating in sync, sending data to one another as well as to the server. ","Our idea is a system to collect ocean data of all sorts and hence is useful to any business , institution or company that operates in maritime activities . Which means any business in any part of the world that operates near their coastline can use our product or service if we set up our infrastructure in those respective locations . Our idea focusses on local fishing businesses but since our service collects large amount of data , this data can be useful to anyone near the coastline . The infrastructure we will set up has its own separate value along with the data that we are providing our customers with . Since we are making our own low cost buoys , these buoys can be further lent separately outside our network for their own purposes . They can be custom fitted and changed to the Businesses needs . When it comes to manufacturing these  these buoys will be made in an assembly line fashion , and by making hundreds and hundreds of these buoys , we will be reducing the cost of each one thats made .","The global Maritime  market size was USD 168.56 billion in 2020, and it is projected to reach USD 188.57 billion by 2028 . There is a huge demand for fast data collection and analysis related to maritime activity . We want to bridge that gap with lower costs and more  accuracy  . There are problems within the maritime space such as extremely  slow or no internet connection . Satellites dont solve all problems  , they cant measure ocean currents or detect underwater waves . They cant show live information of fish or detect ocean temperatures accurately . We need accurate information to reach the people who need it in the shortest amount of  time . Thats what we are trying to solve by building ocean infrastructure related to data collection  . The market potential for such networks is huge . There are many groups  who would benefit from this such as the Fishing industry , Marine research groups , Meteorological societies  , Maritime trade industry , the coast guard etc.  These depends on how much we build our network in sea , and how well its managed . Size will equal the number of  industries that can benefit from this . This idea is such that we dont have all our eggs in one basket , the infrastructure and data we are providing  to fishing businesses is just one of  the many applications of our system . The global maritime market is yet to reach its peaks , and our goal is to be at the forefront when it does .1310",DR. SHAIK JAKEER HUSSAIN  ASSOC.

In a man-woman dependent society, it is important and primary for any man to understand the severe effects of the period illness that is faced by their co-dependent. Every woman uses the means and control methods for the blood flow and they henceforth have to use multiple sources for that.  A few of them include means like sanitary napkins, tampons, menstrual cups, cloth pads, etc. The dangers faced by the woman during this one month are severe. Adding to the already existing plastic crisis, this has been dominantly creating a tougher problem for the world to bear as pads use plastic to be made. The two processes in the model include the supply of the healthy organic pads in the form of a stack and are supplied with one, when a 2 rupee coin is inserted into it making it affordable for all the women.  We have thought to prepare an organic pad using the materials like cotton, double sided tape, a very little amount of plastic to have its shape and the cotton cloth. There is a pad tray for it to be collected from the machine. The function of incinerator is to supply ignition to burn the used pads. Each pad releases a milligram of trash in the form of ash. The smoke that is released after burning of any pad will release the toxic gasses. Henceforth we came up with an idea of using filters. It makes the smoke less toxic. The incinerator that we are using in our machine not only burns the organ",Potential areas for the machine to be used:131082269Airports131082269Educational institutions131082269Workplace131082269Hospitals131082269Restaurants131082269Theatres131082269Shopping malls131082269Railway stations/ Bus stop131082269Hotels 131082269Parks 1310Being a cost efficient machine and easily portable it can be used anywhere where a woman has their place.13101310, Our idea is to create an environment for a healthy menstrual cycle.

This app will provide a convenience of handling schedules and timetables for any events or day to day classes in the particular college. It would be easy to use and the inputs would be given and the timetables can be created using the app itself. The institutions would give the inputs of the schedule for a day, for a week or for even a year. The inputs could be given as time slots of any duration, the faculty or an instructor who will be taking the session, the venue or room number, the subject, breaks in the schedule, etc., and many more can be created. The admin will have control over editing the timetable and the faculty along with the students can access by entering their individual login details. The faculty and students will have the view only option.","Timetables are prepared in educational institutions to have a clear mapping of the schedule to be followed on a particular day, on a specific time and at an intended place. They are must for getting correct info without ambiguity for faculties and students also. Educational institutions often prepare and update their timetables frequently. Now this process is being done mostly by the conventional method of researching all the possibilities of time slots and preparing a perfect timetable which is done by humans. It is a tedious work to perform, it is time consuming and requires lot of analysis. Even though, it is quite often to see sometimes the timetables would not be free from clashes in time slots. So, a mobile application with novel algorithms is required for solving this problem efficiently. The mobile application developed to prepare a platform where timetables would be prepared instantly in just a few clicks.",The educational institutions can take advantage of this application as it provides fast and unambiguous preparation of timetables with minimum or no effort. The work would be done instantly without clashes in the schedule prepared. It would be also easily accessed by any student and it would be a great help for them. The app is not limited to educational institutions of a particular kind but can be used by any kind of institution with minimal configurations. The app could prepare a timetable randomly based on the given inputs but it ensures that all conditions and preferences are satisfied.,"In financial terms, this mobile app has potential to reach thousands of academic institutions across the globe with more than 10 crore business for an academic year. Since it is a cloud-based solution, login credentials are commercialized but the app can be freely downloaded.A major advantage is that the timetable prepared can be random and it can be repeated by a click if the user is not satisfied. Preparing timetables manually in a digital format is time consuming and error prone. In some scenarios, in educational institutions, the particular section of students may not be present in the same class the whole working day as they might move to a lab or any seminar hall. How effectively can humans do this complex work and in how much time? This problem in the educational domain can be solved by using this app. Even though there are many websites where the user can create and edit timetables, it is however done by the user itself killing time. Sometimes, educational institutions even update timetables day by day. This repetitive procedure can be avoided by using the app. This creates a huge necessity in having an app that can handle this instantly. More features can also be added like news and announcements, reminders of the class when there is a class and so on. This app in the market will have the potential to attract a massive user base such as educational institutions of all kinds and students. They will have benefits of accessing their schedules wherever they are.","Dr. G.

Especially in some hotels and restaurants they will serve stale food in some hotels and restaurants.? It is not hygienic, due to which people are suffering from several diseases.? Though this may not lead to some quick diseases, it may eventually lead to some chronic diseases for human health.In some cases, Small scale industries  cannot do better in marketing and cannot sustain during lack of marketing and awareness.  When we are ordering something from a hotel, We cannot compare that hotel with other hotel in case of orders received , customer feedback, delivery expected, prices offered and discount provided.  We are using online platform for food order at a particular restaurant, we will get the satisfactory discount in some rare cases.  This all problems are solved by our idea  ","Newness /uniqueness of the innovation our idea is to supply the food which is getting wasted in restaurants , hotels and at other places at some reasonably low cost to the persons through our app and website. So here the uniqueness is we are going to supply a good quality food of some restaurants and hotels (which has become additional to those restaurants and hotels) at low price to the people. For suppose a restaurant has prepared some quantity of food. Some quantity of the food has been consumed by the people but some quantity has not been consumed. They will throw that remaining quantity of food Into wastage. Instead of throwing that food Into wastage, they can sell that food to us , then we will make that food available to be sold through our app and website.

Generally the restaurants and hotels assume the no of customers who will come to their hotel/restaurant per day. Keeping that in mind , they will prepare the food . But sometimes their assumption will be wrong. Due to that some of the food quantity will become additional. So they will throw that remaining food Into wastage.

Most of the fruits are meant for the fresh market and most of the harvesting is still done by manual, non-mechanical means resulting in a labour intensive and expensive process. The challenges include harvesting the fruit in an unblemished form, protecting the integrity of the trees or plants from which the picking is being done and ensuring the safety of the labourers. Current forms of harvesting include shaking the trees by hand, climbing the trees and using ad-hoc pickers made out of 11scrap material. These methods all cause damage to the fruit, trees and persons. In recent times therefore, this has contributed to the decrease in the production of certain fruits and thus the importation of certain fruits has increased. A fruit picker of height 3 meters was developed to overcome human drudgery by traditional fruit picking practice. Although the device is simple in design, yet very effective. The device consists of clutch lever, a clutch wire, an extension mechanism, a cutting mechanism and head with a flexible basket for fruit collection. It can pick fruits up to a height of 3-4 meter and weighs only 3kgs including handle. The test results of the device showed that fruit picking capacity of and 10-15 kg/h were attained.","the fruits in a specified period of time. Cost should be affordable.

Fruit picker has lots of additional features which are efficient and improve the quality of life in aspect of human ergonomic movements. This included the development of design consideration and concept based from the evaluation of the existing picker. The target harvesting capacity was 15 pieces per minutes. The highly efficient and portable fruit picker not only has high picking efficiency, small size, easy to carry, but also works stably and is suitable for picking a variety of fruits. Modification of the frame, cutter and handle/pole was done to improve its efficiency.In our project we are trying to reduce the man power by implementing a model which 1310can which can pluck the fruit from the tree, which reduces the man power and time.

This would limit one8217s innovation and creativity. This project inspires to make connections across several disciplines rather than learning topics in isolation as it combines mechanical, electronic, electrical and programming skills.  It is introduced for rural areas. A recent report shows that 88 of menstruating women in India are suffering from reproductive problems due to their lack of access to sanitary products. About 23 of girls drop out of schools and colleges when they menstruate. These reasons throw light to the grave necessity of our project to educate and help the women during this period to fulfil needs. 1310Objective: 1.

It is unique because no electricity generating shoe has got a display that shows number of steps taken or the charge status of the battery just like in our mobile phones. This would set 8220smart shoe8221 apart from any of its contemporary products by a lot of distance. This is the uniqueness of the product. Amount of Electricity Generated According to the Rule of Thumb, a person weighing 50kgs would be required to walk 500 steps to produce 1V of electricity. A normal mobile phone needs 5V to charge, so the same person would need to walk 2500steps which is roughly equal to 2km based upon the height of the person, length of each stride etc. This would produce the required amount of electricity to charge a mobile phone.","A human being takes an average of 5000 steps per day. During every step he exerts a force. This pressure generally goes down and into the ground. What if we could generate electricity from our very own step? Incorporating this idea, 8220Smart shoe8221 is a shoe which we put on to for walking, running etc. So this shoe collects the pressure that we exert on the shoe when we are doing any of those physical activities and transform that pressure into electricity using PIEZO ELECTRIC plates underneath the sole of the shoe. The plates are placed in areas where maximum pressure is applied. These plates or transducers are connected in series. When some amount of pressure is applied on these transducers, electricity is produced and this is sent into a rectifier circuit to convert AC current into DC current and from there it is1310send to a capacitor. This capacitor is connected to a rechargeable battery, which is placed inside the heel of the shoe. The energy generated depends on the number of steps. Since a person has a motive of charging his/her phone through this shoe, he would walk or run. This would increase the physical fitness of the people and also when the connect their phones to the 8220smart shoe8221, saves money , prevents global warming and provides a renewable resource of energy. A small USB port would be made available for users to charge their phones. A display screen displays the number of steps, and battery charging for conveniently knowing the status of charging.","8220Smart shoe8221 is a product for all ages right from 15 years to 60 years or even more, anybody can use this product.

However, the Non-invasive Haemometer used for checking the haemoglobin levels works with attributes of no pain, no risk of infections and no biomedical waste. The uniqueness is the method is being non-invasive.","Non-invasive Haemometer measures the haemoglobin levels of a person using a non-invasive method.It captures the palm image of a person, predicts their haemoglobin levels and also displays the precautionary advice.This helps in measuring haemoglobin levels without any invasive test in physical laboratories, thus making it easily accessible.Unlike Invasive measurement,it is painless,doesn8217t require any pricking of fingers for taking blood sample and hence curtails the potential risks for exposure to biohazards. ",The main objective  is to monitor the haemoglobin level of a person in a non-invasive method . ,"Non-invasive Haemometer has huge applications in medical field where the haemoglobin levels have to be monitored instantly.In accordance with the Global Nutrition Report 2021, 53 percent of Indian women are suffering with haemoglobin deficiency (i.e., Anaemic). Anaemia is one among the most prevalent nutritional deficiency disorders in the world which affects all age groups but the most vulnerable are pregnant women, preschool age children and young women of reproductive age. 1310Considering all these facts, it is clear that one has to check one8217s haemoglobin levels regularly. But, pricking ones finger and collecting the blood sample on a test strip often will be a painful process. On top of this pregnant women are easily prone to severe infections on improper pricking procedures.Hence non-invasive method of measuring would be a novel solution.Non-invasive Haemometercan be relevantly used in detection of anaemia.1310A haemoglobin test can be involved in the diagnosis of other health problems like liver and kidney disease, blood disorders,heart and lung conditions.1310Non-invasive Haemometers would be greatly useful in rural areas where less expensive and reliable haemoglobin level monitoring is required. It can be used right from children to pregnant women and aged people.It is portable and gives instant results hence less time consuming.","Technology has always been a essential component in patient care,and one of the major influences of technology has been the the shift in paradigm away from highly invasive diagnostic to non invasive procedures.One such procedure is non-invasive monitoring of haemoglobin level.1310Haemoglobin is one of the main constituents in characterizing the physiological condition of a person. The non-invasive method of haemoglobin measurement ensures painless and continuous real time monitoring .1310The haemoglobin testing devices market is projected to witness substantial growth on account of rising anaemia cases. According to WHO8217s statisitics 1.6 billion people which corresponds to 24.8 percent of population are affected by anaemia.Several federal bodies across globe have started to implement initiatives to spread awareness about illeffects of anaemia.These initiatives could hugely benefit haemoglobin testing devices market in future.1310Increasing establishment of clinics could drive the demand for haemoglobin level testing devices like non-invasive haemometer across clinical facilities. This procedure  minimizes the risk of infection for the healthcare personnel ,eliminates the production of biohazardous squander and also overcomes the shortage of staff in the hospitals.","(1) Mr. R.

The machine can be used to spray pesticides when it is fixed with the pesticide mixture box containing pump and one meter pipe with nozzles on each side. The pesticide and water gets mixed and the pump releases the mixture with high pressure on both sides so that the mixture can be sprayed from the nozzles. The pump and spray set can be switched with a different setup for dispersing powdered content. Solid fertilizers can be sprayed using this machine when it8217s fixed with a shallow bowl more in hyperbola shape containing a rotatory element connected to gear in the middle of bowl which is designed to rotate twice if machine travels 1m such that there is no wastage of fertilizer.

It  provides uniqueness by the addition of speaker-enables the interaction between the kid and the operator camera -   monitors the status of the child Ultrasonic Sensor 8211 used to calculate the depth  Oxygen supply and light .  ",The objective is to rescue the child from the borehole by avoiding the conventional method of rescuing which takes ample amount of time and is proven to be fatal whereas the rescue system on an average takes 1-2 hours. This rescue system stands out from the conventional methods with the use of advanced technologies which in turn helps in saving the life of the child.,"It can be used for rescuing kids who fall in the borehole as it is difficult to rescue them with conventional methods.1310 As manholes will be opened during monsoon for easy flow of water they are often unclosed after the use and there is a possibility of kids to fall in the manholes, our 8220robotic arm8221 can also be used to rescue those kids.1310","According to the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), over 40 children have died after falling into borewells since 2009, and rescue operations failed at least 70 per cent of the time. 13101310Although children falling into borehole is common in the rural areas, unfortunately these incidents are least addressed. There is no proper equipment which has been built to rescue children.13101310The available equipment in the market are not feasible and might hurt the child during the time of rescue.

2266,IDEATS003977,Lellapati Aditya Reddy,TELANGANA,MEDCHAL MALKAJGIRI,Pranayaan Low-Cost Ventilator,"Yes, Patent will be filed for the design product ","Availability and accessibility, pricing of the ventilators is a great concern during medical emergencies like Covid-19 especially in low, middle-income group countries and even to developed countries. The major rationale for the development of low-cost mechanical ventilators was the availability of mechanical ventilation in India during this pandemic crisis.13101310The aim of the project undertaken is to design, test and implement an affordable and easy to access low-cost ventilators which replace and allows a reduction in deficiency of ventilators. The fundamental theme of this project is to give the ventilator in catastrophic conditions. Accessibility of the ventilators in world particularly in India requires an extraordinary change to meet conditions in the current circumstances prevailing in the Covid-19 pandemic. The issue of the availability of mechanical ventilation in India during this pandemic situation was the primary justification for the motivation of low-cost mechanical ventilators.1310","Most of the ventilators implement different techniques to create pressure support. The best technique we optimized in our prototype as we are opting to build at a low cost, the best approach that we have formulated is the yoke mechanism, which is the most efficient one in case of low cost. Driving force is to be provided the yoke, DC side shaft geared motor performs this task. It is extremely crucial to regularly monitor some parameters such as pressure, flow, oxygen concentration, and pulse rate after creating a mechanism for manually creating pressure. 13101310To monitor most of these parameters, we used different sensors such as pressure sensor (MPX10dp), flow sensor (AWS720p1), oxygen concentration sensor (OOM202), and pulse sensor (MAX30102). Each of these parameters is displayed on a 3.5-inch LCD screen with a 240*320 display resolution to enabling a view of the information for continual monitoring. Finally, oxygen is delivered to the patient via supply tubes linked to the oxygen mask, allowing air to flow into the mouth and nose from the Ambu bag on both ends. 13101310The whole setup is to be incorporated in a closed box, with only the display elevated outside and all the hardware part which is unnecessary for the end-user to bother about is hindered.1310","As per the records of WHO, some 80 of individuals with Covid -19 disease are recovering without need of hospital treatment. One individual in six turns out to be seriously ill. To mitigate this, a ventilator is utilized to push air, with escalating levels of oxygen into the lungs. Hospitals and clinics across India are encountering oxygen deficiencies because of the scarcity of oxygen people painting for air on the roads like Fish out of the water8221. To combat with the different variants of Covid821719 there is a need of about 1,200 ventilators each day, but the supply and reach are around 400 ventilators per day. Moreover, hospitals have been confronting a shortage of oxygen supply.13101310Portable oxygen cylinders and chambers with portable ventilator support are the solitary paths for patients in a serious condition to continue breathing at home when they cant access a hospital bed. Most of the ventilators are accessible only in private hospitals for rich people. Low-income group and middle-income group countries are unable to concede the patient in private hospitals due to hefty charges. So, our aim is to design, test and implement affordable and easy-to-build low-cost ventilators which replace and allow a reduction in the shortage of ventilators. These challenges motivated us to think of a solution for this problem and we came with the idea of a low-cost ventilator which could be quite accessible for the poor and economically weaker sections of our country.1310","TAM Total Available Market: There are approximately 48,000 ventilators available in our country (40,000 in private sector and 8,000 in Government sector).The market of ventilators in India is estimated at around 5000 crores. Out of which only 25 are manufactured in India and 75 are imported from different countries. The imported ventilators cost around 12 lakh rupees to 14 lakh rupees whereas Indian manufactured ventilators cost around 3 lakh rupees to 5 lakh rupees.13101310SAM Service Available Market: Only 5.2 of the total available ventilators are from Telangana state. To meet the exceedingly terrible conditions because of this pandemic, India needs to deliver 80 to 100 times the present number of ventilators which approximates to 8 lakh ventilators as said by the experts.13101310SOM Service Obtainable Market: As per the statistics, we comprehended that the vast majority of ventilators are concentrated in private hospitals, that are even at no reach for the common people, 1310our product will be of incredible use particularly for the Govt. hospitals where economically needy people can be profited the most or medicated at ease.1310",Ameet Chavan,17 years of product development and research,Mb 9390638524,Working PoC developed,12 Monts,"Healthcare & Life sciences, Medical Devices, Pharmaceuticals, Biotech, AYUSH and any related sub-sector"

This increases the potential for excess surface runoff, which can lead to downstream flooding, bank erosion and possibly transport of pollutants into potable water supplies. On the other hand, pervious pavers have the ability to reduce runoff volume and improve water quality.1310Pervious concrete is a special type of concrete with high porosity used for concrete flat work applications that allow water from precipitation and other sources to pass directly, thereby reducing the runoff from a site and allowing ground water recharge. This porosity is attained by a highly interconnected void content. Typically pervious concrete has little or no fine aggregate and has just enough cementing paste to coat the coarse aggregate particles while preserving the interconnectivity of the voids.","Pervious concrete (also called porous concrete, permeable concrete, no fines concrete and porous pavement) is a special type of concrete with a high porosity used for concrete flatwork applications that allows water from precipitation and other sources to pass directly through, thereby reducing the runoff from a site and allowing groundwater recharge.1310Pervious concrete is made using large aggregates with little to no fine aggregates. The concrete paste then coats the aggregates and allows water to pass through the concrete slab. Pervious concrete is traditionally used in parking areas, areas with light traffic, residential streets, pedestrian walkways, and greenhouses.12 It is an important application for sustainable construction and is one of many low impact development techniques used by builders to protect water quality.","When preparing to construct each type of pervious pavement, evaluate how the construction of the overall project could affect the ultimate performance of the pavement. Be sure to review and install the selected type of pervious pavement in accordance with current industry standards.1310Protect the pervious pavement from adjacent storm water runoff areas. This is especially critical if the adjacent areas are unpaved. These areas could introduce sediment-laden storm water to flow onto the pavement, potentially clogging the surface and filling the voids in the reservoir. Temporary storm water controls should remain in place until all disturbed areas that could reach the pervious pavement are stabilized.",Now a days water scarcity becoming critical problem in major cities due to the impermeable roofs and pavements.

The piped system conveys and distributes the irrigation water in closed pipes by pressure following the most convenient route, regardless of the slope and topography of the area. With traditional surface methods the water is applied in large volumes per unit of area, while piped irrigation systems distribute the water at as needed rates over a very large area.

2271,IDEATS003706,Anjaiah Adepu,TELANGANA,MEDCHAL MALKAJGIRI,Process of Producing Fuel from Waste Plastics by Induction Heating,No,"According to a survey carried out in India, nearly 5.6 million tonnes of plastic waste is generated annually. Out of this 60 is recycled that means a staggering 6500 tonnes of plastic waste is going as landfills per day. Plastics are manufactured from petroleum products and are made of long hydrocarbon chains. The huge demand for plastic has created a large amount of waste plastic and they pose a serious threat to the environment because of their disposal problems. Plastic pollution is a global problem the majority of plastic winds up in landfills where it remains indefinitely. No one exactly knows how long plastic takes to break down, but it is believed to take hundreds or even thousands of years. It is not just the accumulation of plastics that harms the environment and it is also the fragments, toxins released during photo decomposition that pollute our soil and water. Plastic pollution threatens the environment, so we need clean and profitable solution. The base idea of the research is to producing an alternate fuel from waste plastic, where it has been done by earlier researchers with pyrolysis process. Pyrolysis is a thermal decomposition of plastic waste in the absence of oxygen which is done at a temperature of 400-800oC.Even though plastics are recycled with high temperature it leads to produce toxic gases which indeed again create environmental problems. ","The crushed plastic is dropped in induction furnace where it is heated in the absence of oxygen at a uniform temperature below 100 degree centigrade for several hours where gases are passed through cyclotron where char is collected in char collector and filtered gas passes to quencher where quenching takes place which changes the state of gas to fuel (Plastic Oil) and fuel is collected in oil collector tank and non-condensed gas is also collected in other tank. The three things we get from this is condensed gas, non-condensed gas, char particles Use of Char Particles: 8226 These char particles are rich in minerals like carbon which can be used in fertilizing soil which contains low Ph value. 8226 This can be used in water filters 8226 This can be used as catalyst Use of Condensed Gas: The condensed gas (Plastic Oil) properties will measured and compared with conventional fuels. Produced Fuel can be used in automobiles, machineries and any fuel related applications. Objective of Project: 8226 We can get an alternate fuel to use in automobiles, machineries etc. 8226 Even a high grade plastic can be recycled only six times such plastic can also be used to get fuel. 8226 Toxic gases can be controlled compared with burning plastic to a higher temperature in pyrolysis plants. 8226 Reduce waste going to landfill and greenhouse gas emissions. 8226 Reduces the country dependence on importing energy by generating energy from domestic resources.","It can be used in Internal Combustion engines instead of Conventional fuels. 8226 It can be used to generate electricity. 8226 It can be used to produce petro chemical products like Vaseline, lubricants, paraffin wax, detergents, crayons, etc.","India imports 80 of its crude needs mainly from gulf nations and we are in third position in importing crude oil after US and Japan. The increasing population density of automobile leads to demands more fuel consumption that leads to reducing the availability and also raises the cost and hovering. Therefore, it is necessary to search for an alternate fuel, which can replace effectively, the conventional fuel without much affecting the engine design and operation. A common solution to the above two problems is converting the plastic waste into usable fuel form. The produced plastic oil price may depend on the mass production which may be more or less to the conventional fuel price.","Dr. Mohammadi Akheela Khanum, HOD CSE, SPEC","19yrs, Ph.D",6392854076,6months,1year,"Miscellaneous Sector (Environment, Forests, Water & Sanitation; Foods, Beverages, FMCG, Consumer Goods; Infrastructure, Construction, Housing; IT, ITES, Electronics, White Goods, Telecommunication; Metals, Engineering, Machinery, Automation and Transportation, Automotive, E Vehicles, Railways, Aviation, UAV and any other sub-sector)"

We are making a working prototype of it.,"In a country like India, agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 58 percent of its population. It plays a major role in contributing to the Indian economy as a whole. Agriculture is considered as the backbone of the economy, advancing 16 percent of total GDP, and 10 percent of total exports in the country8217s economy. In terms of farm output, India stands second in the global picture for agriculture.1310When it comes to various adaptations of technological resources and sectorial augmentation (in terms of farm produce, the quality of the grains etc.) agriculture has come a long way. Agriculture is an age-old subject, refining it with the technological advancements, i.e. use of IoT  AI, taking place within the sector over years.1310Technology has very subtly but immensely entered the field of operations in agriculture. With its advent, the various farming techniques and solutions that it provides has been very helpful to the farmers, to anticipate the growth of various crops and manage the natural drifts.1310","To automate the farming shifts to Precision farming for better crop yield and improvement in quality while using fewer available resources. Automated machines and development of online based agriculture monitoring system will contribute in technological advancement in the future. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based agriculture help farmers in identifying more systematic ways to protect their crops from plagues, weeds and also contribute in showing better ways to produce, harvest High yield crops. 1310","The use of AI technology ensures that conventional farming operations be uplifted and modern farming techniques like organic farming, vertical farming etc. can be adopted and transparency in farming decisions could be achieved.1310Agriculture and farming are one of the oldest and most important professions in the world. It plays an important role in the economic sector. Worldwide, agriculture is a 5 trillion industry.1310The global population is expected to reach more than nine billion by 2050 which will require an increase in agricultural production by 70 to fulfil the demand. As the world population is increasing due to which land water and resources becoming insufficient to continue the demand-supply chain. So, we need a smarter approach and become more efficient about how we farm and can be most productive1310By integrating with IoT solutions, close monitoring of fields could be done using different sensors such as weather data, soil moisture, light intensity, humidity, temperature etc. Farmers using these techniques can optimise inputs to the field and continue treating the issues based on the action suggested by the system.1310AI also empowers consumers with complete knowledge of a product cycle. Right from harvest to the end of the production cycle, the use of technology allows farmers, brands, and consumers to access all the information they need. AI-based farm management systems ensure food safety.","Benefits of AI-based farm management1310AI in the agricultural processes has a lot of significance. To name a few - farming/plot lending risk assessment, sourcing and procurement planning, smart sampling points for crop-cutting experiments, agri-market intelligence and water monitoring and conservation. 1310Digitisation and use of AI-based farming will lead to higher quality crop yield, and will look to increase the wealth of the farmers. Through AI-based farm management, they will be able to demand higher prices, have better visibility, and be more in control of their farm-to-sale experience.1310The various technologies that have been adopted in the agriculture sector have made farming a tech-levied experience. Artificial Intelligence combined with IoT leads to predictive intelligence which brings in much needed efficiency, reliability and preciseness in the process.

According to the Forest Survey  of India Report, about 50 percent of the forest area in the country is fire prone, About 6 percent of  the forest is prone to severe fire damage. It is due to the different climatic conditions such as  extreme hot and arid weather, severe drought and even due to lightening and human unawareness.  The forest fires often start unnoticed and spread very quickly, causing millions of dollars in damage and claiming many human lives every year in the many countries.","Every year, thousands of forest fires across the world cause disasters including thousands of  hectares of forests and hundreds of houses. This leads to a lot of loss lives, nature, and vegetation.  So, there is a need to devise a method or technology to effectively deal with forest fires. One of  them is using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNS). The wireless sensor networks are commonly placed  for early warning of forest fires. They can detect and forecast the forest fire more promptly than the  traditional satellite based approach. Here, we explore the use of wireless sensor network technology  in real-time forest fire detection. In the wireless sensor network, large numbers of sensors are  densely deployed in a forest. The sensor node collect the measured data like temperature danger,  relative humidity, flames, smoke - all those factors that are responsible for calculating the forest fire rate. If the sensor detects fire, it gives an alarm along with a notification message to the fire forest office  ","These can be not only used in forests but also can be applicable at power  stations,hospitals,educational institutions  Another application about these project is that we can find a missing person who is lost in the forest  or attacked by a wild animal.The thing person should do is just to establish a fire near the sensor so  that we can track the persons location","IIn the ongoing market of full ideas for fire detection,our project will be helpful  in providing a faster output in fire detection and also plays a major role  eradicating the forest fires",Mrs.N.Nagalakshmi,15 years,9985469949,Ideation stage ,12 months,"Miscellaneous Sector (Environment, Forests, Water & Sanitation; Foods, Beverages, FMCG, Consumer Goods; Infrastructure, Construction, Housing; IT, ITES, Electronics, White Goods, Telecommunication; Metals, Engineering, Machinery, Automation and Transportation, Automotive, E Vehicles, Railways, Aviation, UAV and any other sub-sector)"

2334,IDEAWB004356,Sanket Roy,WEST BENGAL,Jhargram,"RNAi pesticide as a specific, customizable, and eco-friendly alternative of chemical pesticides",not applicable,"Agricultural pests are a significant threat that impacts food production throughout the world. Due to various shortfalls, conventional insecticides are not the ideal candidates to curb this menace. Genetic manipulation of the target plants using various insecticidal genes have also been found ineffective. However stringent regulatory rules for using genetically modified plants have necessitated the search for a non-transgenic yet environmentally safer approach for controlling agricultural pests. Therefore, in this invention, a novel method using nanoparticle-based RNAi pesticide for controlling the pest infestation and subsequent realization of the optimum yield potential of this crop is advocated. It is anticipated that the proposed invention will be instrumental in developing a non-transgenic yet environmentally safe approach for overcoming pest infestation on economically important agricultural crops. Further, these Nano-assisted RNAi pesticides (NaRi) could be a powerful tool in future plant protection strategies where dsRNA produced in vitro can be directly applied on crops via foliar application. Apart from controlling the pest infections, it is assumed that in future Nano-assisted RNAi pesticides (NaRi) could be applicable against several kinds of plant diseases caused by pathogenic viruses, bacteria etc. Most importantly, NaRi will be an environment friendly, easy to apply tool for the farmers in field applications and could revolutionize the pesticide industry.","Biocompatible nanoparticles-based dsRNA-EPs delivery is proposed for efficient control of agricultural pests. For this purpose, dsRNA-EPs will be designed against critical pest genes and following their in vitro processing, these dsRNA-EPs will be conjugated with suitable nanoparticles to overcome the natural instability and low uptake efficiency of siRNA. Thereafter, it is proposed that the direct spraying of these nanoparticle-based RNAi pesticides onto the pest population will severely reduce the mortality rate of the pests. Further, this novel nanoparticle-based RNAi pesticide can be formulated as an environmentally safer alternative to chemical pesticides for effective control of pest infestation on important agricultural crops.1310Major Technical Improvements/advancements: 131082269Conjugation of dsRNA-EPs with suitable biocompatible nanoparticles to overcome the natural instability and low uptake efficiency of siRNA.131082269Development of a suitable buffer system for efficient and stable application of nanoparticle conjugated RNAi pesticides.131082269Development of a novel formulation for a nanoparticle-based RNAi pesticide without adverse environmental side effects.","Considering the high potential of RNAi because of its high specificity and homology-dependent silencing of target genes, non-transformative RNAi strategy involving the use of dsRNA containing end-use products (dsRNA-EPs) might become an appropriate strategy to control pests in agriculture. Techniques like root-drenching, trunk injection, dsRNA supply through irrigation water are possible strategies to control root-feeders. Most importantly, use of dsRNA sprays, in which dsRNA-EPs can be directly applied or sprinkled on the host plants has proven to be useful in eradicating insect pests from crop fields.1310Out of all other non-transformative methods of RNAi, spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS) can become the most viable and widely applicable method for curbing insect predation on target crops. Although, application of dsRNA sprays is adequate in protecting crops, long term stability and the cellular uptake of the dsRNA-EPs have emerged as the two most critical factors limiting their widespread application as pesticides. Further, since siRNAs does not readily pass through the cell membrane due to their size and negative charge, effective target gene silencing of RNAi pesticides depends on feeding by the pests. Thus, to overcome this major barrier facing RNAi delivery to the desired cell type, tissue, or organ of the target pests an assortment of versatile targeted delivery platforms for RNAi pesticides could be achievable using nanotechnology. ","Over the last century, the world population has quadrupled from 1.8 billion in 1915 to around 7.3 billion people now. Further, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 severely increasing the global food demand. Food demand is anticipated to increase somewhere between 59  and 98  by 2050. Thus, to meet this huge demand, there is an urgent need to increase the crop production, either by increasing the productivity or minimizing the yield loss of these agricultural crops. It is estimated that essential food crops of the world are damaged by more than 10,000 species of insects, 30,000 species of weeds, 100,000 diseases which are caused by microorganisms like fungi, viruses, bacteria among others and 1000 species of nematodes. In India pests result in significant yield loss in major agricultural crops like cotton, rice, maize, rapeseed mustard, pulses, sugarcane and wheat.1310In India, agriculture is seen as the driving force. Approximately, half of the total population is driven by cultivation and contributing almost 19 to India8217s GDP in 2020. But due to attacks of pests and weed, they lose a significant part of their income. In a report of Indian Institute of Vegetable research, tomato farmers in the country lose up to 65 of their yield due to the attack of fruit borers every season. 1310According to recent data, in 2020, the pesticides market in India reached a value of INR 232 billion by sales with an annual growth of 10.3 over 2019.

8,IDEAAP002785,Pragada Venkata Vinay,ANDHRA PRADESH,VISAKHAPATNAM,Low cost manual tuber vegetable product cleaning machine,There are no IP conflicts and we are not using any existing IP.,"In India, in the modernization era, food production in sufficient quantity is no longer the immediate concern, instead now, it is necessary to address apprehensions related to minimize post-harvest losses. In fact, cleaning is one of the post-harvesting key activities of certain agro products growing under the soil like potatoes, ginger, carrot, turmeric etc. Particularly small and marginal farmers are unable to clean properly prior to market their products. In consequence to this they are getting less profits for their products.In such context, the proximity of agro-product cleaners will give scope to encourage farmers for producing more products and marketing the total yield. At present certain agro-products cleaners were developed, but they are not available at affordable prices to small and marginal farmers. Not only this, non-availability of electrical power is also one of the causes for not using agro-product cleaners. In this context low cost manual tuber vegetable product cleaning machine has been developed. The proposed model is suitable in areas where there is a lack of proper electrification. The operation of this machine does not require electric powerand it works with the use of human muscle effort only.The proposed model is available at lower cost and it helps to avoid the squander of agro-products.  It is possible to empower small and marginal farmers through marketing their cleaned products for achieving greater value realization.","Principle and working of the proposed machine  The proposed Low cost manual tuber vegetable product cleaning machineworks on the principle of forced vortex flow. Centrifugal force caused by the continuous rotation of the cylinder leads to the separation of mud and dirt from the agro-products like potatoes, carrots, turmeric, etc.   (b) Description     The cleaning machine consists of two concentric cylindrical drums as shown in figure 1. The outer drum is made of plastic and the inner drum is the perforated/Mesh framed aluminum cylinder. The outer drum is fixed whereas the inner drum is rotated by means of hand operated lever (rotating hand lever).     More than half of the outer drum is filled with water and certain portion seeps in to the inner mesh framed drum. The agro products of (5-10 kg) to be cleaned are placed in the inner drum.  The operator rotates the inner drum with the help of hand operated lever. In order to increase the rotational speed of the drum a gear box maybe attached. The extent of cleaning can be visible to the operator from time to time as it has perforations/mesh.  The continuous motion of the drum causes the separation of mud and dirt from the products and the grey water can be drained through the drain hole provided on the outer drum and is collected in a tank.  The cleaned agro products are allowed to enter the dryer for drying operation.",The proposed model has the capability to be accepted by small and marginal farmers due to its low cost and easy operation without any electric power. This has a market in rural areas especially for small and marginal farmers who have a paucity in the availability of electricity and water at their expense. ,As per the interaction with farmers the Agro product that is cleaned is fetching more profit in the local market than the uncleaned one. This product can be utilized by small and medium farmers to reap the benefits from this model by value addition to their product. The product is easy to assemble and can be made movable and is easy to maintain. The worn out parts can be replaced with off the shelf replacements. The mechanism used in the working of the product is easily understandable to uneducated farmers.,Dr. B. V.

Each extruder can print with a different filament material. It is useful for building soluble support structures and producing multicolored objects.,Each extruder can print with a different filament material. Having two extruders is useful for producing objects with multiple filaments and multiple colors. A project will require two colors to create a pattern in the design of a 3D printed object.,"At the moment, dual extruders are a simple upgrade to single extrusion. With dual extrusion, two nozzles share the same head and move as one piece. For this reason, 3D printers with dual extruders do not print twice as fast as printers with single extrusion. In order for that to be true, each nozzle would have to move independently without interfering with the other. Once you imagine that logistical nightmare, you understand why dual extrusion is still limited.","The main advantage of buying a dual extruder 3d printer is that you can print in multiple materials. Using multiple 3d printer filament materials is very useful for:13101310To understand the advantages of solid infill one must understand that with a single extruder model and supports are printed using the same material. This means, in the first instance, that the support material will adhere / fuse very well with the main structure which can make them hard to remove.

The external is placed along the battery cells, heat is transferred from the batteries to the Ethylene glycol and water mixture coolant. with the increased temperature the ethylene glycol and water get separated where water selectively evaporates through the membrane (permeate) and is condensed via a condenser placed. The coolant circulation is made possible by a suction pump at the permeate side. During null power condition the battery temperature is balanced due to the evaporation of the water available over the retenate. The condensed permeate reaches the Retenate and the cycle is continued. The proposed solution qualitatively provides cooling at uncertain conditions even when the system lacks power supply. This is made possible by the contribution of potential difference due to the heat generated in the batteries (retenate) and the permeate connected to the ambient temperature. This helps in larger mileage with higher battery life by reducing the power consumption by 75  consuming 25 of the power for coolant circulation. ",Nominal temperature of the battery cells is 23°C- 25°C for maximum power output from the electric vehicle batteries (LI-ION CELLS IN SPECIFIC).

This is not possible in case of physically disabled people but they are given god gifted some great sensing ability. So for this we are creating a new IoT based Smart Stick / Cane which will help the blind people to get known about the hurdles, obstacles and holes or any moving objects beside them. It will be very beneficial for them as it will alert them for each and every aspect which they are going to face in their day to day life with the help of buzzer or voice Assistant. Our system will also track the live location of blind person and Guide the person through it for walking. Our main motivation are they blind who need to suffer a lot while travelling from place to place. We noticed that normal blind canes used by blinds have certain limitations like detecting pot-holes, stairs, distant objects, above knee obstacles, etc. We feel very bad about the blind and disabled people so we came up with the idea of developing a economical sensor equipped cane capable of assisting blind to navigate easily.1310Blind people are liable to get in contact with whatever obstacle which pass before them during walking, subjecting them to risk of injury caused from fall and it could also cause great damage to them.

There is only a little amount of research towards CP. However, this project explores all ways to uplift the lives of the children suffering from this physical disability. This project aims to design a framework with its underlying architecture and mechanisms needed to capture actions and gestures of children with CP live and recognize the same. This project also targets to release product in pilot scale initially before it is given as final solution to all the CP affected families across the globe. This is ultimately a unique product mainly focusing on the core problem of Cerebral Palsy in children. ","Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a physical disability found in children. According to data, for every 1000 live births, there are 2.1 children diagnosed with CP. The CP related health conditions involve problems associated with motor function that led to sensory and cognitive impairments in children. It is recognized at the infancy due to certain lesion and injury to the developing brain. Children with CP face certain challenges such as coordination of mouth and tongue muscles while speaking and people will not be able to listen to them. While listening, children with CP, concentration becomes big challenge. Neurological impairments lead to many other challenges as well. When children with CP want to write, they get fine motor skills problem while showing or pointing at pictures, they get issues fine motor skills while making gestures and using sign language also children with CP get challenges such as fine motor skills. Their lives can be enhanced personally and socially with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technological innovations. This project investigates the necessary mechanisms, designs a comprehensive framework known as Action and Gesture Recognition Framework for Children with CP (AGRF-CCP).1310The core objective of this project is to add value to the children diagnosed with CP and make them feel as playful as normal children. This is possible with this project which is based on Action and Gesture Recognition Framework for Children with CP (AGRF-CCP). ","This project focuses on the medical sector. This project particularly targets the children suffering from Cerebral Palsy. This will result in a software product which can solve the problems of communication of children and other disabilities involved in CP. The purpose of this project is to design and implement a framework known as Action and Gesture Recognition Framework for Children with CP (AGRF-CCP) leading to a working software that helps children to overcome many of their impairments pertaining to speech, writing, listening and playing with expressions made meaningfully. This would add value to the children with CP and help make their life joyful.

In each of the stages, specific studies will be carried out as well.   In hydrodynamic cavitation water treatment studies, it is planned to study  ? The influence of the geometry of the flow chamber on the water quality and  intensity of cavitation.  ? The effect of parameters like of the cavitation number, fluid temperature etc   In acoustic cavitation water treatment studies, it is planned to investigate the effect of the intensity and frequency of the acoustic irradiation on the water quality.","The main challenge is the development of sustainable, energy-efficient technologies, which can steady the supply of high-quality water and is the best solution to global drinking water problems. Hydrodynamic cavitation has the potential to become an energy-efficient technique that can eliminate currently used expensive chemical reagents and also protects our environment. Yet, the use of hydrodynamic cavitation as a sole technique or in combination with other techniques such as ultrasound has not been explored and has great potential. Our main focus is by using hydrodynamic cavitation, we have to remove pharmaceuticals, toxic cyanobacteria, green microalgae, bacteria and viruses from drinking water.13101310The main advantages of controlled hydrodynamic cavitation water treatment are improves efficiency, lowering costs, and meeting environmental sustainability goals. ","The aggressiveness of cavitating flow is mainly related to the kinetic energy, which is transferred to potential energy of the cavitation structure and further on to the energy (amplitude) of the pressure wave at the cavitation structure collapse. Following this reasoning, the highest possible flow velocity and pressure were used. In this regard it is designed to use two facing rotors with special radial grooves, where each one is spinning in the opposite direction. In this design, the rotors (90 mm diameter) are going to be driven by electric motors with power of 0.37 kW each has special geometry, which causes periodically repeating pressure drops is generated. The rotating frequency of the rotors is approximately 2800 rpm are used, which is giving a local velocity of up to 26 m/s.13101310Bacteria 8211Removal Mechanism1310Pathogenic bacteria can cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis and are a major cause of human death.

Among the top 10 global challenges for the new millennium, pure drinking water attributes a lot of significance (Menachem, 2012 Richard, Nobel Laureate, 1996). Water scarcity is a global and a regional challenge and water consumption rate is doubling every 20 years because of exponential and unplanned growth of the population, is posing a key challenge (Elimelech, 2012 Kalogirou, 2005 WHO Reports, 2015). The availability of good quality water is on constant decline and the demand for the same is on the rise. Water shortages and unreliable water quality are considered major obstacles to achieve sustainable development and improvement in the quality of life (Lattemann, and Höpner, 2007). According to the United Nations, over 1.1 billion people lack safe drinking water (Lattemann, and Höpner, 2007 WHO Reports, 2015). In India, about 97 million people are without access to safe drinking water and 40 million people are affected by water borne diseases such as, fluorosis (fluoride contamination), arsenic (dangerous contaminant), diarrhea, cholera, hepatitis (bacteriological contamination) every year (WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program 2012). The Medical expenditure on water borne diseases is estimated to be Rs. 2, 400 crores annually in the country (BARC, India, 2010).","To understand the slums in better way, we have selected five slums and we have conducted ground studies by taking 100 households in each slum.

One of the most important and basic human needs in any country is a good waste management system and when a country is equipped with one, automatically many diseases are prevented from spreading. Waste can take any form, whether it is solid, liquid or gas, and each has different disposal and management methods. Waste management is intended to reduce the adverse health, environmental or aesthetic effects of the waste. Solid waste is defined as non-soluble materials ranging from municipal waste to industrial waste which contains complex and sometimes hazardous substances.13101310In this idea, it is designed and integration of novel eco-friendly solid waste management system with waste heat recovery, which turns any solid waste material permitted to be incinerated into pure ash within minutes and adhering to relevant emission standards. During the process, the temperature inside the closed chamber reaches very high degrees based upon the nature. We are designed to make use of this energy to generate hot water of 200 litres capacity continuously for domestic applications. It is also planned to use thicker insulation prevents thermal radiation, which keeps the equipment cool outside even while it is burning inside. It is expected to remove the headache waste disposal and saves money.1310","Incineration is a waste treatment process which involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials, among different methods of solid waste disposal and management. Waste incineration turns the waste into ash, flue gas, and heat. Most of the ash is formed by the wastes inorganic constituents, and can take the form of solid lumps or particulates carried by the flue gas. Before being dispersed into the atmosphere, the flue gases need to be cleaned of gaseous and particulate pollutants.13101310Energy-recovery incineration is one of the main waste-to-energy methods. Incinerators minimize the solid mass of the initial waste by 80821185 percent and the volume by 95821196 percent, depending on the composition and material degree. The incinerator is the best choice due to a high calorific value of solid waste, which is a comprehensive economic analysis for improved waste management and usage in India.13101310Other advantages are13101.9Reduces Pollution: No chance of polluting local and groundwater sources, as in landfill. 13102.9Filters Capture Pollutants: The release of dangerous compounds, especially dioxin, has been a major concern associated with the incineration of solid waste. Incineration plants use filters to capture toxic chemicals and particulates such as dioxins. 13103.9Bottom ash is reusable 13104.9It provides better control over odour and noise 13105.9Occupies small land.","Waste management is intended to reduce the adverse effects of waste on health and the environment.

In all countries, a nationwide lockdown was imposed in the wake of a formidable adversary, the Covid-19 pandemic. With the number of cases increasing exponentially, hospitals faced a dangerous shortage of life- saving equipment and personnel.13101310Inadequate health care facilities to non-availability of testing kits and labs, protective equipments and advanced medical equipment such as ventilators, India looked utterly unprepared to face the enormity of the crisis. However, the idea of developing an indigenous invasive ICU ventilator was one of the most challenging of its missions. To overcome the shortage of these devices, we dont have a good solution yet, that can help us fulfill this requirement. In regards to this situation, we wanted to design our own Arduino COVID -19 Ventilator. So, we have decided to make a small portable ventilator prototype using Arduino. It will also be capable of monitoring our health and provide data about our heartbeat and SPO2 levels. Our ventilator prototype uses a stepper motor that applies pressure on an air sack (BVM bag), thus pushing oxygen-concentrated air into the lungs. When the stepper motor comes back to its earlier position, pressure is released from the air sack (BVM bag), making it retain its original shape. This system helps to draw out CO2 from the lungs (similar to breathing in and out).1310","This project can be widely implemented in emergency response services, first aid kits, and the medical industry in the coming days. The portable ventilator can be a game-changer in saving human life in case of delayed medical response regarding emergency response kits. It can be implemented in every emergency response vehicle like Ambulances, Fire engines etc. Our main goal is to promote this project in hospitals, especially in remote areas, for a better emergency life support system.13101310However, many existing systems are available, but they come up with their drawbacks like accuracy, quality of screening, and pricing.1310During COVID treatment, some of the benefits of this proposed project are summarized as follows:131082269It works by paralyzing the muscles of the body temporarily.131082269This proposed system includes the muscles that allow us to inhale and exhale.131082269Once the anesthesia stops, the patient can breathe on their own and are removed from the ventilator.1310","The fused filament fabrication class of desktop 3-D printers spawned from the rapid self- replicating prototype is the most advanced manufacturing technology. These designs are manufactured in remote areas and on-demand as needed from readily available (and possibly recycled) materials. These 3-D printers are also readily constructed from widely accessible materials and simple tools.13101310Direct Beneficiaries: Our Institute CMR Engineering College is taking care of this Medchal-Malkajgiri district as a part of Mistry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), Government of India for the national program called Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA), to achieve sustainable development and better quality of life.

Water quality is measured in terms of physical and chemical parameters to determine the condition of water.","The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has established a series of monitoring stations on water bodies across the country which monitor the water quality on either monthly or yearly basis. This is done to ensure that the water quality is being maintained or restored at desired level. It is important that it is monitored on regular basis. Water quality monitoring helps in evaluating the nature and extent of pollution control required, and effectiveness of pollution control measures. 1310CPCB has plans to establish water quality monitoring network across Ganga river basin. All the stations will operate in real time and central station can access data from any of the above stations using GPRS/GSM or 3G cellular services. State pollution boards and CPCB zonal offices can also access data from central station. Large amount of data can help to take right decisions and also to implement in time accordingly.","The global water quality monitoring systems market is expected to reach 6,692.3 million by 2025, from 3,815.9 million in 2017, growing at a CAGR of 7.3 from 2018 to 2025. The quality of water resources has a direct effect on daily life. Polluted water is commonly discharged in large water bodies in the urban as well as rural areas owing to environmental degradation and heavy industrialization. This causes water contamination, which is hazardous to human life. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 2 billion people drink contaminated water containing harmful pollutants. Thus, there is an urgent need to adopt water quality monitoring systems for analyzing and examining the water quality. This project is very much in demand in commercial , Residential, Industrial and Utility places where water quality is very much required. Cost of the system depends on number of parameters to be measured.","Dr. A.

The unique feature of the idea is the interviews can be conducted in huge numbers at the same time and could save millions of rupees. ","The AutoHire has the following objectives, Create a web-based solution to conduct virtual technical interviews with the candidates, To evaluate the interview using AI without any human intervention, Assisting companies to shortlist the right talent using candidates8217 interview performance, To conduct and evaluate multiple interviews seamlessly, and Ensure companies and students spend little time and resources getting campus interviews completed. AutoHire Platform is an Artificial Intelligence-based automated interview solution and a web-based application currently in development using python based web framework. The candidate can take his/her video interview using a smartphone, laptop, or personal computer. First, the system extracts the audio file from the video interview input using the FFMPEG library. Once the audio is extracted, a model is used to generate the text for the audio input and set to extract two sets of keywords. This text will be forwarded to the text-similarity model in which the Siamese BERT Networks generate a fixed-length embedding vector to generate the answer. This embedding vector will be compared with another embedding vector generated using the expected answer given by the company. Then, the system utilizes the cosine similarity technique to compare the embedding records and generate the score. This score will be taken to generate the average score answer and to recognize the capability of the candidate.","This AutoHire platform will enable the companies to run virtual campus technical interviews with the candidates without having a dedicated technical team to evaluate the candidate in the interview.

It includes platform cost, interviewer availability, and a lot of environmental factors. The proposed idea, the Autohire application doesn8217t require much environment setup since it has its own interface to record the candidate interviews. It also has its own evaluation architecture to evaluate the multiple candidate interview performances in the background smoothly without human intervention. AutoHire application will fit the use cases where it is required to conduct technical interviews for any job roles starting from the entry-level to the senior level, as the complexity of the questions can be controlled on demand. This application also helps individual candidates to prepare for the technical interview by using some of the pre-fetched questions on the internet.

35,IDEATN002894,Jothi vignesh Ramamoorthy,TAMIL NADU,MADURAI, PORTABLE TOOL HOLDING DEVICE FOR FRICTION WELDING MACHINE,no,"Friction welding was described where it was shown that by using a combination of rotation (movement) and applied force, two copper tubes could be joined in the solid state. The geometry of components that can be friction welded in production is confined to round, square or rectangular sections. Before 1991 it was not possible to use friction techniques to butt weld plates longer than 100 mm together. However, in that year, FSW was invented, and has gone on to be remarkably successful for butt-welding a wide range of aluminum alloys.The FSW technique was readily adopted by the aircraft, aerospace and transport industries involved in the fabrication of aluminum alloy components, due to the reproducible production of high integrity welds, in contrast with some conventional welding methods. Instead of rubbing the contact faces of two plates together to generate frictional heating, a different approach is taken in FSW. The heat is generated by using a rotating tool, which does not deteriorate in any way during the welding process. This rotating tool is forced into .the interface between the two plates, which are clamped tightly together. The rubbing action of the tool generates sufficient heat to soften the plate material adjacent to the interface. Once a suitable temperature has been reached, the tool is translated along the length of the interface to join the plates together. A sketch of FSW in action.","The aim of our project is to design a tool holding device which simplifies the work and improve the accuracy of the welding. The working principle of our device is little different from other tool holding device of welding machine. The aluminum work piece is held in the vice. The two pieces of aluminum work piece is welded with the help high speed drilling head with friction tool. The working principle is very easy and at the same time production time is very much reduced. This machine is best suitable for mass production.Friction Stir Welding is a promising process and has clear advantages in terms of the mechanical properties of the welded material. FSW has already found great applications in the Aluminium industry. Therefore it becomes imperative to try to use it with other materials Including stainless steels. Friction Stir Welding provides a novel, relatively hazard free, solid phase joining process, which produces sound longitudinal joints, especially butt, in a range of materials and thicknesses. The FSW process is already in commercial use and has been found to be a robust, parameter tolerant, technique that has much to offer in the welding aluminium alloys.","LFW is commercially established as a technology for the fabrication of titanium alloy integrated bladed disks (blisks) in low temperature sections of aero-engine. LFW offers many advantages when used to manufacture blisks. For example, conventionally manufactured titanium alloy bladed disk assemblies are reliant on mechanical fixings and dovetail joints. LFW allows for the blade to be integrally joined to the disk, which significantly reduces the weight of the component. The lack of a mechanical interface between the blades and the disk also eliminates a common source for fatigue crack initiation, which is often the life limiting feature of these parts. Moreover, linear friction welded blisks offer better aerodynamic performance, which helps to lower the overall operating costs for the end user.Owing to the many benefits of LFW, the process is finding increasing industrial interest for the manufacturing of aircraft structural components. Metallic aircraft components are typically machined from oversized ingots, forgings and extrusions. This is an expensive process due to the proportionally large amount of material that is purchased compared to the amount that remains after machining. For example, buy1310-to-fly (BTF) ratios of 20:1 are not uncommon. LFW reduces the material required to make a component by joining smaller work pieces to produce a perform, which is subsequently machined to the desired dimensions.

36,IDEATN002900,AATHI J,TAMIL NADU,MADURAI,EGG CLEAVER,No,"Egg Cleaver has several features that are highly beneficial. Some of them are,1310Detection of decayed eggs: The eggs are decayed will be removed before processing.1310Self-Cleaning technology: A technology that starts cleaning the machine when insisted. 1310Egg shell crusher: The shell waste after breaking well be crushed by a crusher.1310Low cost and Man power reduction1310Less power consumption1310There are only minimal machines of these kinds. But machines in foreign countries are large in size and costlier than our product. There are companies that use those machines being imported from the other countries. Those large companies can invest lakhs in these kind of machines but not the small and medium scale industries. Those available abroad are of advanced technology and skilled workers are required, but we have brought simple mechanisms that makes a locally trained worker to operate this.1310","Our solution is in form of a machine. Egg cleaver, an automated machine that helps in breaking the eggs and separating the yolk and albumen. This also helps in neglecting the decayed eggs and then process the eggs in order to avoid spoiling the entire portion by a single decayed egg. 1310The size of the machine will be 70x30x100 cm that will be compact in size. This makes affordable for all scales of industries. It has the ability to operate 6 eggs every 2 seconds. Hence totally 11,000 eggs are broken and separated in an hour. A simple mechanism that generates the breaker in breaking and tray helps in separating albumen and yoke. Also a setup helps in removing the decayed eggs. Egg cleaver functions with a 12W gear motor. This motor runs the chain conveyor and pneumatic power generates the reciprocating motion of the breaker. By this operation, it rectifies the problem and stands to be a best solution. The cost is calculated such that they can be easily affordable. It will around Rs. 20000 INR. This amount will be a onetime investment and this will be highly beneficial for the customers. Hence the customer by spending this money can address the problem and achieve his need. Also we have planned to opt automatic cleaning system. This will help in cleaning our product in best way. ","Problem with Small scale industries like bakeries is they cannot afford in lakhs to install the currently available machines. Similarly, small shampoo factories, Cosmetic industries, Pharmaceutical Industries face the same issue. All these industries require only a particular part of the egg (i.e. either albumen or yolk). Unhygienic factors are involved in the bakeries when manual operation is functioned.","Food industries, Pharmaceutical industries, Bakeries, Pastries, Shampoo factories and Cake producers are the target customers. They use albumen and yolk separately or both together. So, they are in need of using our product. Some of the industries do this operation manually, as mentioned earlier they are time consuming and requires more man power. All these customers by spending this amount can reduce man power and complete the work quickly also in hygienic manner. As the physical contact of the eggs is omitted, this doesn8217t involve unhygienic factors in the process. Due to this corona pandemic, people also request these kind of things to be used instead of man power. So, customers can choose our product for their needs. It has the ability to operate 6 eggs every 2 seconds. Hence totally 11,000 eggs are broken and separated in an hour. This ability will enhance their operation. As the system uses a simple mechanism a very well trained operator is not required. A single operator is required only for monitor and starting and stopping the machine. The major reasons they can opt our product is for the low and reasonable cost, simple mechanical behavior, reduced man power and easy handling.","Dr. T.

Usually, heavy metals cannot be decomposed or biodegraded. Marketwise water purifier is not properly removed such type of heavy metal ions. Now a day researcher are too much interested to developed environmental friendly polymeric materials that act as a good adsorbent for metal ions. Conducting polymer that contain free active functional groups (such as 8211OH, -NH2) act as a good adsorbent for metal ions due to complexation with free functional group. Nano structure conducting Poly(o-phenylenediamine) act as metal adsorbent due to its high active surface area and free amine/imine functional groups. The structure of the polymer like polyaniline with free NH functional group. Poly(o-phenylenediamine) with free 8211NH2 functional group also synthesized from phenylene diamine monomer in sulfuric acid medium in presence of APS as an radical initiator. So both polymer may be used for heavy metal detection and sensing purpose since these polymers are biodegradable and low cost for synthesis. ","Due to global warming and environmental pollution the underground water level gradually decreases and maximum part of India (like- Madhya Pradesh, Gujrat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Delhi) the scarcity of water is predominant as a result we have to recycle and reused the water liberated after household and industrial activity.

In the already existing technology, they are using mini-vehicles with sensors to detect potholes but our application collects the data from the users so there is no need for new infrastructure. ","In India many roads require maintenance and repair, it is hard for the government and contractors to send people there physically to check the road condition and it is expensive to hire many people and it is also a time taking process to check the roads, it is better to have a system which can tell the location of the damaged road without human interference. There are autonomous vehicles which can precisely locate damaged roads and give reports to authorities but we can8217t run an autonomous vehicle all over a vast country like India, So we plan to develop a software which can track people8217s smart-phones and record the accelerometer readings and try to locate the potholes. Use GPS location to Geo-locate these pothole locations or at least tell the location of roads in which they are present. In this project we take data from millions of mobile phone users to improve accuracy. A ledger can be maintained of repaired roads and roads due for maintenance which will produce the truth of repair which no survey can tell, hence it leaves no chance for corruption.And it is better than all the available alternatives being used now.","Our software observes the change in values of x,y,z axes of the piezoelectric accelerometer which is inbuilt in all smart phones, so we can determine the unevenness of the road based on the spikes on the graph which are plotted by recording the values of accelerometer.1310We can tell that the vehicle passed a pothole if the accelerometer readings fluctuate greatly. As soon as a spike occurs, the Geo-location is recorded. And it is checked with multiple other inputs from other devices to improve accuracy as much as we can.1310Satellite images and images taken from common people can also be Geo-tagged to improve accuracy.1310An image processing software and deep learning CNN can be used to process these images and detect potholes.",The government contractors can use this software to not only detect pot-holes but also detect pavement distress cells which cause the occurrence of potholes in the same place even after multiple road repairs.

There is urgent need  for early  detection and easily accessible biomarkers of dementia that could  aid stop the progression of disease. Since this disease is most common in elderly subjects, an ideal biomarker for dementia screening has to be reliable, predictive, reproducible, non-invasive, simple to perform, and inexpensive. The currently available biomarkers are including structural and functional neuroimaging, genetic factors, and biochemical analysis of blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Alzheimer8217s disease (AD), is the most common form of dementia. And there is similarity between the retinal and cerebral microvasculature. The available retinal imaging modalities are fundus camera imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The development of higher-quality and faster OCTs allowed clinicians to examine individual retinal layers with greater detail. Only trained technicians can perform segmentation, identify features or delineation of boundaries of retinal layers to allow measurements. This process involves time and fatigue factors. For small studies, it is reasonable, and provides the benefits of accuracy and precision. For mass screening  to be feasible, a more streamlined process is necessary In ophthalmology, deep learning has been applied to automated diagnosis, segmentation, big data analysis, and outcome predictions. One of the important AI-based applications in ophthalmology.","According to the Dementia India Report  by the Alzheimer8217s and Related Disorders Society of India (ARDSI), there were around 3.7 million Indians with dementia in 2010 with the number projected to rise to 7.6 million by 2030.The condition of retinal vessels has capability of reflecting the condition of the cerebral vasculature. It is found that anatomically and developmentally, retina is an extension of the brain. The fundus camera photography is used to measure, observe, and quantify microvascular retinal features and abnormalities.The other retinal imaging modality is Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT). OCT is a non-invasive imaging tool that can produce three dimensional cross-sectional images of the retina and permits precise and accurate measurement of the thickness of individual retinal components diagnosis can be done by trained people only. The solution is automated segmentation of images. Recent image processing technological breakthroughs with  computing power has led to deep learning, a relatively new subfield of machine learning that involves convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 1310Objective :To capture the images of the eye using fundus camera and OCT1310To analysis the image using deep learning 1310To identify the significant features for discriminating the severity of the disease1310To validate the features using clinical scores and brain image features 1310","According to WHO 2050 up to 131 million people would suffer from Dementia. In spite of the advances in understanding of pathogenesis and clinical practice , the availed  clinical treatments are limited. Most of the patients have advanced AD followed by irreversible neuronal damage. Hence there is need for early intervention can slow the progression of AD. Epidemiologic study shows one-year delay in the onset of AD would reduce the projected global burden by 9 million. The elderly subjects are finding difficulty in neuro imaging for continuous treatment and mass screening. The proposed process is alternative for mass screening of the Alzheimer8217s. The proposed work will be easy for mass screening of the prelevant disease It can be used in the dementia specialized hospitals and used by neuro doctors  1310","The markrt potential is 5.5 crores in India .It is estimated that In India alone number of subjects affected by dementia will exceed 14 million by 2050. There is a crucial need for a additional precise and prior diagnosis of AD. The gold standard methods like PET are affluent and invasive, making mass screening problematic. The eye-based biomarkers are a novel area for AD diagnosis as the ocular region has many similarities, both neural and vascular, with the brain. In this work the prominent features were thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer , deposits of Aß  and changes in retinal vascular parameters such as narrowing of the vessel and reduced blood flow. The literature study emphasises the need for earlier diagnosis and, hence, AD8217s treatment due to the evidence that retinal alterations occur early. Using the retina is an easy, non-invasive way to diagnose and manage AD when it is still in the early stages. The market potential is high in the Hospitals, neuro clinics, research centres and educational centres of study of dementia.The cost of examination by proposed method is cheaper that current existing techniques ,affordable, easy, noninvasive.

50,IDEAAP003002,GANDURI VENKATA SIVA RAMAKRISHNA,ANDHRA PRADESH,GUNTUR,Agro-industrial residues utilization for economical production of Levan biopolymer,"Levan was secreted extracellularly from sucrose-based substrates by wide variety of   bacteria, including genera Acetobacter, Bacillus, Erwinia, Gluconobacter, Halomonas,   Microbacterium, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Zymomonas. Each of these bacteria have   utilized different (synthetic) sucrose and (natural) sucrose-containing substrates for their   growth, levansucrase synthesis and produced varied levan yields. But this idea does not use   any of existing intellectual property. The current idea utilizes Jaggery, agro-industrial residue,   a conventional non-centrifuged, unpurified and concentrated sugar cane product, containing   75-80 sucrose as raw material for levan production in pilot-scale conditions, using   Halomonas variabilis. The produced Levan has numerous properties like chemical and water   holding capacity, viscosity, film formability, capacity to dissolves in oil and water, chemical   resistance and heat stability, which draws it as an extraordinary biopolymer.  ","Biopolymers find enormous applications in today8217s era. For the past few decades, numerous uses have been identified for Levan polysaccharide, but only limited numbers have been commercially realized due to non-availability in meaningful quantities. While Levan production in laboratory is straightforward, bottlenecks in the downstream process have hampered its scale-up. Technical issues like large volumes of alcohol, impracticality of dialysis on a large scale and unavailability of ultrafiltration equipment have complicated the Levan purification. The unique combination of properties that distinguish Levan from most other polysaccharides has long attracted attention. Effective and economical strategies for the production and purification of such biopolymers increases the extent of their usage in industrial, medicinal and commercial cosmetic sectors which is eco-friendly and raises no environmental or health concerns on plant, animal and human life. Although, Levan was produced extracellularly by wide range of microorganisms, its production was significantly affected by fermentation conditions. The novel Halomonas variabilis is known for its ability to produce high quantities of water-soluble biopolymer, when grown on sucrose, can be grown on low-cost agro-industrial residues like syrups, molasses, pomace, etc. for more economical production of Levan. So, the present idea is to develop an economical production (including purification) process and its applications.","Agro-based industries all over the world rely heavily on the supply of raw materials from farmlands. These industries, after production generate huge tonnage of agri-industrial wastes that are improperly disposed of and cause environmental pollution and serious health threats to animals including humans.  The utilization of these agro-industrial wastes to produce useful products emphasizes their biotechnological potentials for efficient value addition. In India, there is a problem dealing with large quantities of agro-industrial wastes that are generated from agro-processed raw materials, which the agro-industries essentially do not have any use for. Rather, these wastes are poorly disposed of into the environment, either at the backyards of the agro-industrial plants or are cart away by waste management companies to landfills to rot. The proposed idea is designed to carry out up- and down-stream process of Levan fermentation using Halomonas variabilis MTCC 3712 on agro-industrial residues. In the first stage, a variety of agro-industrial wastes/ residues such as syrups, molasses, pomace, carobs, Jaggery, etc. will be used to produce Levan in bench-scale conditions. Further, fermentation will be carried out in a pilot-scale reactor and improve yields, reduce economics involved in Levan biosynthesis. Further, the powder will be collected into heat-sealable plastic bags and these bags will be kept inside an air-tight container with silica gels, for further release into markets.","Though microbial Levan can be synthesized from sucrose as carbohydrate substrate, several agri-industrial wastes/ residues (that are rich in sucrose content) could be utilized with ecological soundness, economic advantages and low or negative costs. The major obstacles of efficient recovery of microbial polysaccharide lies in the energy consumption and operating costs involved in polysaccharide recovery. Further, these would open the new ways for further elucidation of Levan recovery in cost-effective manner and promotes the usage of purified Levan elaboration in industrial, medicinal and commercial cosmetic sectors. In this way, regional development seems to feasible with creation of small and medium enterprises (SME8217s) that will give rise to new jobs and protect environment from pollution. The present market price of highly purified Levan is ?20,000 per gram and is imported from USA in 1- or 2- or 5-gram bottles. Currently, there is no Indian Biotechnology company is producing this Levan due to low yields. So, the present invention addresses the following questions, in an elaborate manner: (i) Utilization of all agro-industrial residues as substrates to produce microbial Levan under submerged conditions (ii) Economical and novel production strategies to explore for Levan commercialization (iii) New purification strategies employed to obtain the synthesized Levan in a cost-effective method.","Levan biopolymer possess excellent general properties like bio-compatibility, bio-degradability, renewability, flexibility and exhibits biomedical properties such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenesis, anti-AIDS, hyperglycemic inhibitor, etc. Potential applications of this biopolysaccharides include as prebiotic effects, anti-tumor effects, cholesterol-lowering effects, eco-friendly adhesive, thickener in food industry as stabilizer, emulsifier, sweetener and flavor enhancer in beverage industry as biomaterial purifier, nanofilms/composites in biotech industry as immunostimulant, anti-inflammatory agent in biomedical industry as excipient, emulsifier, encapsulating agent in pharmaceutical industry. Levan has numerous demonstrated used in food industry as film forming agent, prebiotic compound, as stabilizer in beverages in feed industry as modulator of human body functions (like anti-tumor activity, fluid stool, immunostimulatory, etc.) in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries as an active ingredient, moisturizer in medicine industry as blood plasma expander, cryoprotectant, and also in agriculture industries.

Our approach is significantly different and uses in vitro, ex vivo and Bioinformatics tools to generate antibodies at a fraction of the cost and in a fraction of the time compared to conventional antibodies.13101310The points below summarize the novelty of our approach 13101310Immunization of animals is not required. Our library theoretically represents most of the naturally occurring possibilities of antibodies naturally occurring, thus saving several months in time and related expenses. 13101310Our Yeast display techniques for protein ensures effective post-translational modifications and thus, enhanced function of the expressed and selected antibodies.13101310Our library is optimized to be expressed in yeast, based on yeast codon preferences thus reducing expression inefficiencies. 13101310Our clones are tagged and antibodies are expressed on yeast surface thus enabling FACS based screening. This ensures efficient screening compared to the conventional yeast colony screening approaches.13101310Our approach also provides the opportunity for a rapid transition and improvement of our libraries through Machine Learning.","AIM and Objective: To establish a platform technology that would allow for rapid, and cost-effective identification of Single Domain Antibodies against 8216difficult antigenic8217 targets.13101310Conventional production of the single domain antibodies involves immunization of llamas and subsequent clonal screening, a process that is far from ideal to generate such antibodies in large numbers at a rapid pace. This is due to the amount of antigen required, time required for immunization, etc.13101310Certain classes of molecules such as proteins 8216covered8217 with carbohydrates or motifs hidden in the lipid regions of membranes, metabolites and other small compounds, are poorly antigenic. Examples include certain GPCR domains, Ion channels, cancer specific intracellular antigens. Of paramount importance and relevance to the developing nations are similar challenges in development of Diagnostics and Therapeutics against infectious diseases caused by antigenically variable pathogens such as Leishmania, Plasmodium, Dengue virus etc.13101310Here, we propose a novel way of generating antibodies against such difficult antigenic targets. This proposal would result in the generation of a platform, that would be representative of the antibody diversity of Cameloids and would thus mimic the system in vitro. Single Domain antibodies (sdAbs) against virtually any target could be generated without animal immunizations.1310","In house RD efforts will be in three major categories for the use of these antibodies, Therapy, Diagnostics, and Biosensing.

The leading player in the nanobody field however, is Belgium based Ablynx. They are currently the only company with an FDA approved Nanobody therapeutic.1310Diagnostics have a high value due to their increasing role in the early detection of diseases and in many cases in a minimally invasive way. Antibodies against potential targets that fail in the final stages of clinical trials can be very attractive for use as a diagnostic tool. We will actively work with partners to develop early diagnostic tools for diseases of importance to India.1310Immunoassay based biosensors have a very high selectivity due to the high specificity involved in an antigen-antibody binding. Small molecules like antibiotics, drugs, and other chemical agents can be easily detected using such biosensors. Our platform technology will circumvent the problems faced with traditional immunization methods that generally fail to develop antibodies against such molecules.1310","Market Size: It is widely accepted that biologics like monoclonal antibodies are the future of therapy, owing to their specificity.

53,IDEATN003009,Partheeban,TAMIL NADU,KANCHIPURAM,AIR-PURIFYING PAVER BLOCKS USING NANOCOMPOSITES,This is one of the new idea in manufacturing paver blocks. Since it reduces the air pollution in the admosphere.,"1310The air purifying approach is a promising new idea in the cementitious materials field, with the potential to create a new strategy to maintain a cleaner city by reducing air pollution in metropolitan areas. The photocatalytic reaction has the potential to accelerate natural oxidation and pollutant breakdown.1310Air pollution in India is a major problem, 27 of air pollution is caused by vehicular emissions. The major pollutants released from Vehicles are carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (NO), photochemical oxidants, etc. Such pollutants can be reduced by air-purifying paver blocks. An eco-friendly approach to producing air-purifying paver blocks without the use of cement is to use geopolymer concrete. In this innovation, to produce photo-catalytic concrete paver blocks, fly ash is replaced partially with Titanium dioxide (TiO2) to accelerate the gain in strength in ambient temperature as elevated temperature curing involves higher energy. No water curing is required and the air purifier paver block is left at room temperature for curing. Titanium dioxide is a heterogeneous photocatalyst that absorbs nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) and converts them to nitrate ions (NO3), which are either rinsed away by rain or soaked into the concrete to create stable compounds. Titanium dioxide improves the effectiveness of photo-degradation of air pollutants. Titanium dioxide is a semiconductor material that acts as a photocatalyst and initiates the reaction.","Air purifier paver block leads to minimization of air pollution that hereby decreases the harmful effects of those gases to a certain extent by photocatalysis. When nanomaterial like TiO2 is incorporated in concrete paver blocks, air purification process can be done automatically because of the photocatalytic action. When nano air-purifying paver blocks are exposed to solar and ultraviolet (UV) light, photocatalysts degrade organic and inorganic contaminants into less hazardous forms. The use of photocatalysts in combination with cementitious materials has several advantages. It has the potential to dissolve undesirable organic compounds on concrete paver block surfaces, which are easily washed away by rain. 1310OBJECTIVES13101.9To design, develop and implement the air purifier paver blocks using nanocomposite materials to minimize pollutant levels in the atmosphere and hence eliminate photochemical smog. When nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) combine with sunlight, photochemical smog is created, resulting in brown clouds. 13102.9To design and arrive an optimal mix proportion to achieve a maximum strength of air purifying paver block using nanocomposites in concrete as per IS 15658-2006 for Non-traffic to very heavy traffic conditions.13103.9To find out the percentage of harmful air pollutant reduction due to laying of nanocomposites-based air purifying paver block. 13104.9To design a permeable nanocomposites air purifier paver block  test its suitability","As per market demand quantity can be increased 8211 Approximately 5000 paver blocks can be produced per day per unit. Nano air purifier paver blocks find applications in pavements, footpaths, gardens, passenger waiting sheds, bus stops, parking areas, airfields, industry, and other public places. The product is commonly used in urban areas for the above applications. Hence, the unit may be set up in urban and semi-urban areas, near the construction activities. A lot of face-lifts is being given to roads, footpaths along the roadside. Air purifier paver blocks are ideal materials on the footpaths for easy laying, better look, and finish. It can be used in the foot path of parks which will be useful in reduction health effect due to air pollution such cough, asthma, cancer and breathing problem to a greater extent. 1310The excellent engineering property and durability of eco-friendly nano air purifier paver blocks extend its versatility for construction and building roads, building pavements, dams, reservoirs, underwater works, canal lining, irrigation work, etc. Enormous amounts of fly ash are usable in all the states in and around thermal power stations. The demand for pervious paver blocks could be fulfilled by setting up small units near thermal power stations and satisfying local demand with fewer transport costs.1310","Paver blocks have been extensively used in a number of countries for quite some time as a specialized problem-solving technique for providing pavement in areas where conventional types of construction are less durable due to many operational and environmental constraints. Air purifying paver blocks gives a solution for environmental pollution issues and it is a new approach in the construction of pavement using Interlocking Paver Blocks. Nanocomposites that are incorporated in paver blocks provide a solution for environmental pollution due to their photocatalytic action.  Air purifier concrete blocks are cost-effective and give good strength and durability when compared to ordinary paver blocks. A properly designed and constructed air purifier paver block gives excellent performance when applied at locations where conventional systems have lower service life due to a number of geological, traffic, environmental and operational constraints. It is applicable for light, medium, heavy, and very heavy traffic conditions. Mass production under factory conditions ensures the availability of blocks having consistent quality and high dimensional accuracy. Maintenance of air purifier paver blocks is easy and simple and it is not affected by fuel and oil spillage due to the photocatalytic action. A very high market demand is there for the air purifying paver blocks. It can replace the existing paver blocks and have high market demand."," Y J Breetha, Assistant Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, Chennai Institute of Technology, Kundrathur, Chennai 600069","M.E., (Ph.D) 8 years","Y J Breetha, breethayjcitchennai.net, 9962425238","We have prepared Nano air purifier concrete paver block with selected mix designed in such a way that it attains the required strength and permeability without compromising each other.

This type of inverter requires more DC link voltage than required voltages. Formation of higher DC link  voltages leads to several issues such as leakage currents, safety, higher voltage and stresses on devices. Moreover, this pulse width modulated voltage source inverters produces modulated voltages rather than pure sinusoidal voltages, results in poor power quality and common mode voltage issues. Hence these inverters demand ac side filters lead to increase the size, cost and volume of the system.  1310Proposed inverter utilizes small passive components between input and output side to provide the required voltage gain, leads to reduced DC bus voltage requirement and results in the safety, leakage current and voltage stress on the device problems. Moreover, the same passive components provide good decoupling between DC and AC, and ensures pure AC voltages without need of additional filters on AC side. Which in turn reduces the cost, size, volume and power quality issues. 1310","This inverter has several unique features, such as a) designed with lower number of elements and small passive elements, b) time delay circuits for dead band generation will not affect the power quality, c) reduces the voltage  stresses on the capacitor, d) offers better power quality (very low voltage and current THDs) without any ac side filter and e) reduced voltages stresses on power semiconductor devices.

60,IDEATN003034,Satheesh Kumar Shanmugam,TAMIL NADU,COIMBATORE,Modern electrophoresis device for early detection of sickle cell anaemia among the tribal communities in India,No,"The proposal finds the scope in detecting the presence of unnoticed sickle cell traits in the blood stream using suitable Field Programmable Gate Arrays. The proposed design incorporates the usage of typical Analog to Digital Converter and Flash memory with various configurable logic blocks connected via programmable interconnects.  The proposed design helps to diagnose N number of blood samples which are collected from various tribal grounds. Even though there are various diagnostic devices on the market, but still those devices are inconvenient because their systems are bulky, heavy, expensive, or inaccurate. The proposed a design is based on the impedance measurement of red blood cells which consists of a test strip that collects a blood sample helps in identifying the prevalence of different genetics of sickle cell among the tribal community. This helps to group the genetically variant sickle cells and the affected people for serving suitable level of medication to stop the further spread of SCD. In addition, many tribal communities are inhabitant lovers where the possibility of bone marrow transplantation with long stay at diagnosis and treatment centres is found to be misshapen. So, contactless and short time results are invoked in the proposal which could avoid such sensitivities among the women tribal community.  ","Sickle cell anaemia is caused by a mutation in the gene that tells the body to make the iron-rich compound that makes blood red and enables red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs throughout your body (haemoglobin). In sickle cell anaemia, the abnormal haemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen. Both mother and father must pass the defective form of the gene for a child to be affected. If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one normal haemoglobin gene and one defective form of the gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both normal haemoglobin and sickle cell haemoglobin. Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don39t have symptoms. They are carriers of the disease, however, which means they can pass the gene to their children.13101310Objective:13108226To develop a non-invasive portable integrated circuit for improving the chromatography techniques for sickle cell anaemia diagnosis.13108226To detect sickle cell features in the blood as early as possible in order to prevent disease spread.13108226To map the prevalence of the sickle cell gene in different tribal groups and within the tribal group that spread over the large area.","The proposed innovation would be an alternative for the following treatments:1310(a) Blood transfusions- In a red blood cell transfusion, red blood cells are removed from a supply of donated blood, then given through a vein to a person with sickle cell anaemia. This increases the number of normal red blood cells, which helps reduce symptoms and complications. Risks include an immune response to the donor blood, which can make it hard to find future1310donors infection and excess iron buildup in your body. Because excess iron can damage your heart, liver and other organs, if you undergo regular transfusions, you might need treatment to reduce iron levels.1310(b) Stem cell transplant- Also known as bone marrow transplant, this procedure involves replacing bone marrow affected by sickle cell anaemia with healthy bone marrow from a donor. The procedure usually uses a matched donor, such as a sibling, who does not have sickle cell anaemia. Because of the risks associated with a bone marrow transplant, the procedure is recommended only for people, usually children, who have significant symptoms and complications of sickle cell anaemia.The procedure requires a long hospital stay. After the transplant, you will receive drugs to help1310prevent rejection of the donated stem cells. Even so, your body might reject the transplant, leading to life-threatening complications.1310But, the cost of bone marrow transplantation in India starts from 15000 USD.",The proposed device can able to provide the following key deliverables:13108226 Secure the extinction of tribal society from sickle cell disorder13108226 Early detection of the sickle cell traits among the collected samples to improve the life span of the tribal13108226 Non-invasive method in the place of surgical options will reduce incision made on the patients13108226 Real-time deterministic control using FPGA to interface with different age groups of factitious community 13108226 Assistance for effective SCD treatment by categorizing the genetic variants of sickle cell anaemia using FPGA13108226 Use of FPGAs in diagnosis can directly affect the life safety of  SCD affected tribal and high requirement of safety and stability,"Dr.K.Raghu  Consultant Haematologist, Arunodhaya Medical Center, Coimbatore","30 years and MD(PGI), Dip.Haem",6381992932,Field visits to native tribal communities in and around Nilgiri districts were completed and collected the samples.

67,IDEATN003104,A Sabah Afroze,TAMIL NADU,VIRUDHUNAGAR,Improvised Odourless Napkin Disposal Machine,No,"Waste disposal has become a growing problem in India, since the plastic used in sanitary napkins are not bio-degradable and result in environmental and health dangers. Every month, 353 million women and adolescent girls across India need to immediately dispose their waste as they did not want the menstrual waste in their houses so they disposed it away without thinking much about how it will be creating impact. Taking 8220Swachh Bharat8221 slogan in mind the ultimate objective of our project is to clean India without Pollutants and plastic free. Sanitary pads are burned without any safety measures. The currently available incinerators have disadvantages like bad odour, high power consumption and high smoke. This will lead to discomfort in the concerned area as well as land pollution and unhealthy environment. As known, nearly a third of commercial pad waste had a wet weight of over 20 g, which was associated with moisture content (MC) exceeding 50 wt. High MC waste is attributed to the practice of washing pads prior to disposal. Moist waste may result in pollutant emission and incomplete processing by onsite incinerators.

68,IDEATN003111,Angeline Raghu Babu,TAMIL NADU,KANCHIPURAM,TRASH TO TREASURE  A COST EFFECTIVE  ECO-FRIENDLY BIOPLASTIC FROM AGRICULTURAL WASTES FOR USE AS HOSPITAL BED COVERS ,No  The idea doesnt involve existing intellectual property and deals with a novel combination of agro wastes that are employed in the production of eco-friendly bio-plastic bedspreads that can be used in hospitals to prevent contamination and transfer of infectious diseases.   ,"Plastics have become a major concern, especially plastic bags and sheets that are used and thrown away in huge numbers enter the ecosystem are consumed by the ruminants and the marine world and depict in the higher level organisms in the food web causing plastic poisoning.  Conventional plastics once produced are non-biodegradable and takes decades to decay, while more plastics are dumped cause serious concerns on the health of the inhabitants of the world.  1310Bioplastics though being a good source of alternative to the conventional plastics, manufacturing of the bioplastics involves use of chemicals and components that pollute the environment not being 100 percent eco-friendly. Eco-friendly and cost effective alternatives are required to create a world free of plastics. Hence we propose a 100  eco-friendly bioplastic composite from abundant agricultural wastes that could be employed in manufacturing films for plastics bags and food parcels, mainly to use as single-use disposable hospital bed covers with 0 percent toxicity.  1310","The effects of bioplastics on marine life have raised red flags. A polymer PLA can leach toxic chemicals. PLA plastics are generally made from the sugars in cassava, corn starch, or sugarcane.  This is the same material that was found to contain toxicity levels similar to that of petroleum-based plastics like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyurethane (PUR). This is because thousands of chemicals are used to make plastic, and some are added to PLA to make it behave like plastic.  1310We investigate the combination of rice straw powder and seed polysaccharide powder as a binder instead of artificial plasticisers, along with other natural additives.  Rice straw powders have already been researched for mechanical strength of the dry and wet powder that was well comparable to polystyrene in dry state and similar to plasticized poly (vinyl chloride) in wet state as cast material. The novel combination of natural raw materials, that are available in abundance, could benefit in providing a cost effective alternative for plastic and could prevent environmental pollution.  1310Objective:1310Development of a cost effective, environment friendly bioplastic made out of agricultural waste mainly comprising rice straw and seed kernel powder available in abundance, to favour bioplastic production along with agricultural waste management. ","The estimated market growth of biodegradable plastics is considered very low, since the cost of manufacture is high, but expected to grow rapidly in India and China, since current studies reveal the rapid progress in the area of research.  1310The novel bioplastic film could be used in the production of eco-friendly bio-plastic bags, water bottles, films for food packaging, and especially for hospital waste disposal and hospital bed covers to prevent communicable diseases.","The global bioplastics market size was valued at 5.8 billion in 2020, and is projected to reach 16.8 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.5 from 2021 to 2030.

When blood is present, the heme in the blood catalyzes the conversion of alpha guaiaconic acid into a blue colored quinone called guaiacum blue. Unless heme is present, this reaction is too slow to produce visible colour change. The proposed kit will be affordable. The cost of the product is being reduced by fivefold by replacing the expensive film coated pads in existing kits with newly formulated liquid reagents. This device is easy to use and can be used by anyone at home.

Further development can be done and more other patents and publications   produced. Details of the published patent are attached at the end of the document. ","Transdermal Drug Delivery System has been used extensively nowadays revolutionizing the biomedical industry serving its purpose of the low-cost medication. Even though there are various ways of drug delivery systems counts to eight, out of all, the most commonly used are oral and intravenous drug delivery systems. But the main disadvantage of these systems is a first-pass effect, in which the concentration of drug gets reduced before it gets into system circulation. So, in order to counteract this, a transdermal drug delivery system came into existence. Iontophoresis is one of the mechanisms used for transdermal drug delivery where a small amount of electrical impulse generated by an external source is used to penetrate the drug into deeper layers of the skin.1310The development of more sophisticated drugs has demanded the need for more sophisticated methods to deliver those drugs. One of such methods is Transdermal Drug Delivery System. This method uses skin as a barrier to deliver the drug directly into the bloodstream. It increases the therapeutic efficiency and provides the drug at a controlled rate. However, the present available transdermal patches internally have the current generating circuit to be discarded after a few uses. So, the aim of this is to separate out the current generating circuit and make it a device so as to make it reusable and cost-effective. Electronics can be reused and electrode patches can be discarded after one use to save subject power.","The objective of invention: To design a reusable, cost-effective transdermal electrode system as a portable device and development of transdermal patch in order to address the adverse effects of oral and intravenous drug delivery methods. 1310Summary of the invention: 1310?9The developed Transdermal drug delivery device has been tested unethically and yielded fruitful results. This has been found very useful in the case of injecting drugs to infants and diabetic patients. 1310?9The cost of the device is low so that it is available to all kinds of people which is the main advantage of this invention. 1310?9Tuning of current irrespective of skin type is possible, an added advantage.1310?9The device can be made compact by integrating the components onto a PC board, thus making ","The present invention relates to the research in transdermal drug delivery systems. It has marked a significant and revolutionary change in the biomedical industry and made substantial contributions by its ever-growing advancements in the delivery of existing and novel drugs. However, the presently available iontophoresis systems are heavy, expensive, and are available with the patch but after a few uses, these have to be discarded along with the patch. So, a portable, battery-operated, low-power, reusable, and cost-effective system is developed as a device that can be used with the transdermal patch to inject the drug into the bloodstream. It can be tuned to 100 µA - 4 mA for a load of 100 O - 12 KO. Here, a constant current can be maintained over a wide range of load (skin) resistances which make it advantageous over other systems.  1310Potential Areas are the Health sector and improvement of quality of human life. This device is highly useful in the case of diabetes patients as they take insulin injections frequently and plays a major role in infants as their veins are very thin as it is a difficult task to inject the drug through conventional methods. 131082269This is a reusable, cost-effective, portable device131082269The inclusion of a potentiometer in the device has the added advantage of protecting the skin from the adverse effects of high currents if any. 131082269The patch used here are of low cost (less than 5 Rs) and can be discarded after one use.","There is a huge market potential for this,1310?9Diabetic patients more than 70, and on regular basis, it is needed,1310?9For infants and old people the needle-less/non-invasive technique will be effective.1310?9Expected mothers can use it very effectively in their routine process.1310?9The common ill, mentally challenged subjects can be used effectively. 1310To variants can be provided to get market: 1310?9For electronic flexible patch, inbuilt battery and circuitry is 200 to 300 Rs range.  1310?9For electrode flexible patch (less than 5 Rs), and one-time external banded battery and electronic device circuitry (400 to 500 Rs) range.1310So, with the above-said device models, we can touch millions of subject people.1310In UK and USA, these patches are sold for 100 dollars for 4/5 numbers.1310In India, we can generate money at the rate of Millions of sales electronic smart devices (300/400 Rs) and billions of use and thorough simple drug hold patch (5 Rs.","1.

The process envisaged is completely new.,"The present invention relates to an industrially viable manufacturing process for preparation of gabapentin, in particular to a process for preparation of gabapentin by green chemistry approach using continuous flow chemistry. The present process is simple, and can reduce the purification process of intermediates, reduce the production cost and obtain the product with higher purity. A novel process will be developed on 100 g scale for the preparation of gabapentin. Around Five synthetic routes have been developed by a number of companies to produce Gabapentin at industrial scale. All the described routes present some degree of concerns regarding safety. The implementation of cyanation and organometallic chemistry at manufacturing scales of gabapentin using batch equipment can be challenging due to the hazardous nature of the reagents employed, and the tight control of reaction parameters, including cryogenic temperatures, that help to afford acceptable selectivity and conversion for the desired reaction. Chemists working in a pilot plant often face safety issues during scale-up operations of gabapentin.  Application of continuous flow chemistry offers a means to mitigate the risk associated with handling large amounts of hazardous reagents and to better control the reaction parameters. Hence a facile system will be optimized to avoid solid accumulation and allow the preparation of the pure desired material over a working day using continuous flow chemistry.","Gabapentin is a synthetic analogue of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. It is used for the treatment of epilepsy, peripheral neuropathic pain, such as painful diabetic neuropathy. Gabapentin is among 53 highly essential key drug intermediates and bulk drugs that are hardly manufactured in India today. Many attempts have been made to develop a facile route for the synthesis of Gabapentin but most of them are having safety, purity and economic issues. Existing reported synthetic strategies for the preparation of gabapentin high mass and heat transfer performance is involved. Hence a continuous flow microreaction system has been envisaged to intensify the synthesis process of Gabapentin at relatively low temperature with lesser residence time. The present invention relates to pharmaceutical chemicals synthesis field, and in particular to a kind of continuous method for preparing Gabapentin and the process for purification. 1310Primary objectives: Process for preparation of gabapentin from readily available starting materials with simple preparation procedure, lower production cost, and higher purity following green chemistry approach. Development of a method to prepare 100 g of pure Gabapentin over a working day using continuous flow chemistry in microreaction system. Development of a facile route for the purification of intermediates and final product.  1310Secondary objective: Profiling of the major impurities produced during the process development of Gabapentin.","Gabapentin patents have already expired, and generic versions of the drug are widely available. Since the patent date already expired many Gabapentin manufacturers around the globe actively manufacture this drug. There are now over 300 different gabapentin drugs marketed worldwide. Gabapentin is one of the most highly prescribed medications, with over 44 million yearly prescriptions registered in the U.S. alone. So there is a huge demand for the Gabapentin bulk drug. However the production cost of the bulk drug is always a big challenge.  Recently the government of India has implemented the strategy to reduce dependence on China and be self reliant on the production of live saving and critical medicines throughout its production chain. Around 53 key drug intermediates and bulk drugs that are hardly manufactured in India today are being identified by the government on which our country will test self-reliance to fulfill the dream of Atma Nirbhar Bharat.

","The Gabapentin and Nortriptyline market has witnessed growth from USD million to USD million from 2017 to 2022. With the CAGR, this market is estimated to reach USD million in 2029. Current India gabapentin (plain) market is 125 crore and total market including combination is 600 crore and it is expected to grow at a steady rate during the forecast period.  Gabapentin market can be segmented into epilepsy, neuropathic pain, restless legs syndrome, seizures, others. Among these, neuropathic pain segment is expected to witness high growth in the market over the coming years on account of high growth in the number of population having chronic progressive nerve diseases. A group of French researchers in 2021, reported that neuropathic pain may either indirectly result from COVID-19 or may be directly caused by the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the nervous system. Hence the efficient use of Gabapentin for the treatment of neuropathic pain is expected to drive this segmental growth in the years to come and there will be a high demand for Gabapentin bulk drug. Gabapentin alone and its combination forms are considered costly medicine and this attributes to the high cost the Gabapentin bulk drug. Hence a process that yields efficient large-scale production of Gabapentin bulk drug and its key intermediates under safe, green and reproducible conditions at low price would fulfill the market demand especially Indian market.

The primary and secondary of the transformer can be independently connected either in star or delta. There are four possible connections for a 3-phase transformer bank.The magnetising current and voltage drops in impedances have been neglected. Under the balanced condition, the line current is a v3 times the phase winding current. In this configuration, the corresponding line and phase voltage are identical in magnitude on both primary and secondary sides.The secondary line-to-line voltage is in phase with the primary line-to-line voltage with a voltage ratio equal to the turns ratio.If the connection of the phase windings is reversed on either side, the phase difference of 180° is obtained between the primary and the secondary system. Such a connection is known as an 180º connection.The delta-delta transformer is satisfactory for a balanced and unbalanced load.If one transformer fails, the remaining two transformers will continue to supply the three-phase power. This is called an open delta connection.If third harmonics present, then it circulates in a closed path and therefore does not appear in the output voltage wave.The phasor diagram of the ?-Y connection of the three phase transformer is shown in the figure below.

Thus, the connection is called -30° connection The Y-Y connection is not satisfactory for the unbalance load in the absence of a neutral connection. If the neutral is not provided, then the phase voltages become severely unbalance when the load is unbalanced.1310The Y-Y connection contains a third harmonics, and in balanced conditions, these harmonics are equal in magnitude and phase with the magnetising current. ","PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION: To open the LT line,open the AB switch(Air break switch)on the transformer.In the transformer, the three phase line is connected with the moving contact.For the maintenance, all the three moving contacts of transformer should be in open.Incase by error if any one moving contact didn8217t open properly means the wireman might experience electric shock.SOLUTION OFFERED:To avoid getting exposed to the electric shock,wireman can use our LTLC detector which detects the electromagnetic radiation from the fixed contact which carries.The star-delta connection of three phase transformer is shown in the figure above. The primary line voltage is v3 times the primary phase voltage. The secondary line voltage is equal to the secondary phase voltageIf one transformer of delta-delta connection is damaged or accidentally opened, then the defective transformer is removed, and the remaining transformer continues to work as a three phase bank. The rating of the transformer bank is reduced to 58 of that of the actual bank. This is known as the open delta or V-V delta. Thus, in open winding transformer, two transformers are used instead of three for the 3-phase operation. thus Let the Vab, Vbc and Vca be the voltage applied to the primary winding of the transformer. The voltage induced in the transformer secondary or on winding one is Vab. The voltage induced on the low voltage winding two is Vbc. There is no winding between points a and c. The voltage may be found by app.","A Hall effect sensor is a type of sensor. It detects the presence and magnitude of a magnetic field using the Hall effect. When the device is placed within a magnetic field,  the magnetic flux lines exert a force on the semiconductor material which deflects the charge carriers, electrons and   holes. This device is detect the air flow in five meter distance. when the leakage current flow through the LT line is detected by LTLC detector by a wireman in five meter distance. Within a five meter distance current flow detected by a device. The Vca is equal in magnitude from the secondary terminal voltage and 120º apart in time from both of them. The balanced three phase line voltage produced balanced 3-phase voltage on the secondary side.If the three transformers are connected in delta-delta configuration and are supplying rated load and if the connection becomes V-V transformer, the current in each phase winding is increased by v3 times. The full line current flows in each of the two phase windings of the transformer. Thus the each transformer in the V-V system is overloaded by 73.2. It should be noticed that the load should be reduced by v3 times in case of an open delta connected transformer. Otherwise, serious overheating and breakdown of the two transformers may take place LTLC DECTECTOR the wireman can easier to detect thecurrent by the 5meter electromagnetic radiation in the wire of flow of electron in the wire the current create the radiation of the electo magnetic field.

Thus, the system would help prevent depression from becoming severe and untreatable which in terms would save a number of lives of depression patients, improve the quality of life of the patient and substantially decrease the cost associated with medical care.","To the best of our knowledge, rarely any work has been done in the field of severity scaling of depression as well as no application has been developed which deals with the detection of depression in a mobile environment. Presently no wearable device has been developed for monitoring of depression . There are mobile based application that deals with the monitoring of depression using questionnaire based criteria. But presently there is no application that could detect depression and monitor depression based on EEG signal in mobile environment. In this innovation, we would develop a model which would provide better accuracy for both detection as well as severity scaling of depression. The proposal also includes the development of mobile based application that provides a user-friendly interface and mobility for monitoring of depression using EEG signal as well as conventional questionnaire-based system. The mobile application would also have the facility for providing reports and updates to the user as well as to the health care provider. The application would have the facility to automatically show notification and warning to the user as well the health care provider when the depression becomes severe. The application would also provide suggestions for overcoming depression based on therapy applied by healthcare professionals.","Dr. Rakesh Kumar Sinha, Professor and Head, Bioengineering and Biotechnology, Birla Institute of Technology(BIT), Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand- 835215","19 years of Research and Teaching Experience,M.Sc.

The cart will use electric power (electric charging  solar module) to drive the juicing operations and for the locomotion of the cart itself. The possibility of integrating juice chillers or ice boxes will also be explored.1310Not only will each Colwho eliminate 10 kg of Co2 emissions per day per cart, but it will also integrate services with the physical product (cart) to improve the operators processes and experience. By encouraging customer spending through digital payment (UPI/e-wallets), earning of each operator will be tracked, enabling them to access financial services (loans, insurance etc.) through different partners.1310The business will generate its revenue from cart leasing by juice operators. Based on anecdotal evidence, an average cart operator incurs between INR 12k-15k towards diesel in Delhi/NCR and a cart rent of around INR 5k-6k per month. This paying capacity will be exploited for financing the monthly leasing of the electric powered juice carts. ","The juice being a summer favourite and highly recommended in ayurveda, fresh sugarcane juice cart, mostly running on diesel genset, are common sight across India. Colwho8217s objective is to improve the income and life of a sugarcane cart operator all the while also reducing air pollution.1310An average cart operator uses 4-5 ltrs ( 1 gallons) of diesel every day. As per US Environment Protection Agency, 1 gallon of diesel emits 10 kg of CO2 this is besides the pm 2.5, pm 10, nitrous and sulphur emissions from these diesel gensets. Thus, we aim to provide cleaner livelihood alternative to the juice cart operators.1310Secondly, the sugarcane stored on the cart is exposed to dust and street side pollutants and the juicer is subjected to flies and contaminants such as grease. While the benefits of fresh sugarcane juice are known, due to hygiene issues most consumers prefer carbonated drinks or packaged fruit juices. 1310Therefore, Colwho seeks to redesign the sugarcane cart through modern design principles and integration of electric powered mobility and juicing solutions. Also, based on the monthly revenue data per cart and through partnership with fintech companies, the operators may also access financial services like banking, credit, insurance etc. The monthly consumption data will also aid in the backward integration with sugarcane farmer. Can achieve three UN SDG (8, 12  13) goals: decent work  economic growth, responsible consumption  production and climate ","In accordance with the Government of India8217s 8220Aatmnirbhar Bharat8221 campaign and the target of net zero carbon emission by 2070, the electric-powered modern sugarcane cart 8211 Colwho 8211 will be used to convert traditional diesel-based carts into greener livelihood projects. By adding modern design aesthetics, the carts will be made more productive and appealing. This will ensure that consumers will be once again drawn to sugarcane juice carts. This will help protect existing jobs and at the same time provide new opportunity to seasonal workers. Secondly, by keeping tabs on revenue and sugarcane consumption at every location and for each cart, the income potential and inventory requirements will also be projected. These will be exploited to make the system efficient and provide greater services to the cart owner.","Based on anecdotal evidence, there are around 300-400 sugarcane carts in the Noida/Greater Noida region of Uttar Pradesh. With monthly expenditure on diesel at around INR 12k-15k, it is safe to estimate that sugarcane cart owners in this area pay between 35 8211 45 lakhs on diesel (approx. of 300 carts). Conservatively estimating that some 150 of them are also renting their carts currently for INR 5k-6k this figure comes to around 7.5 8211 9 lakhs. Thus, the total addressable market size in terms of revenue potential is between 40 8211 50 lakhs. If Colwho is able to attract 50 of the cart owners, then the monthly lease earning is between 20 lakhs 8211 25 lakhs in peak season (6 months) and between 16 8211 20 lakhs in lean period in the larger Noida region. 1310The business potential grows significantly if operations are scaled across tier-1  tier-2 cities of top sugarcane producing states in India, namely: Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Tamilnadu. 1310Another potential revenue can also be made from carbon offset.

103,IDEAUP003322,AJAY PARTAP SINGH,UTTAR PRADESH,MEERUT,STEERING CONTROLLED HEADLIGHT,The idea is totally unique and does not involve any existing intellectual property.,"This technology is not used in any automobile company till now. This have features of moving the headlight along with motion of steering. In this technology we have used two headlights for any vehicle, one is moveable with steering and another will be fixed and give the front visibility. This is main uniqueness in this idea because it will save the life of many peoples who die due to sharp turn on hilly roads as well as ghat roads. Rack and pinion, recirculating ball, worm and sector Rack and pinion animation, Rack and pinion unit mounted in the cockpit of an Ariel Atom sports car chassis. For most high volume production, this is usually mounted on the other side of this panel. Many modern cars use rack and pinion steering mechanisms, where the steering wheel turns the pinion gear the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion). This motion applies steering torque to the kingpins of the steered wheels via tie rods and a short lever arm called the steering arm. The rack and pinion design has the advantages of a large degree of feedback and direct steering feel it also does not normally have any backlash, or slack.","The aim is to design and develop a  Advance Steering controlled headlight Mechanism which acts as directional headlights. This is done by connecting headlights and steering. Present-day automobiles dont have an effective lighting system. Due to this many accidents are taking place during night times especially in ghat and Hilly sections. The accidents can be avoided by incorporating the Steering Control Headlight Mechanism. In this project we attached two headlights in which one will be fixed as usual and another will move according to rotation of steering at some angle. The rack and pinion steering gear mechanism is used for this project. When the steering wheel is rotated and rotary motion is converted to translatory motion through the rack and pinion mechanism. When the front wheels are steered, the headlights follow the same path and the light is focused on the more divergent area. In the present project, it is planned to design Steering Controlled Headlight Mechanism . Apart from turning the Headlights using cables mechanically, we can also turn this electrically using switches and cables as well. By introducing this Steering Controlled Headlights Mechanism, the Headlights cast their beam in the direction of the curve and ensure better visibility during night drives on ghat roads. This provides a smooth and safe ride, mind free ride for the motorist, and it is a safety system for an automobile.  ",Automobile industries have millions turnover in a year. So there are huge potential of this idea in this automobile sector. This idea can high level demands in automobile industries.  ,"Experts blame sharp turn and absence of adequate road signs as the major  factors for the high number of accidents in the hill states. As many as more than 1,100 people died in road accidents in the three hill states of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand in the two years. So this is huge no of accidents which show a need for a better lighting and advance lighting system.

Feeding by yellow mites causes curling and twisting of leaves leading to malformation of terminal leaves and flower buds. In case of severe infestation it may cause upto 60 percent crop loss. The pests are controlled by chemical pesticides viz., imidacloprid 17.8 EC, abamectin 1.9EC, dicofol, sulphur 80Wp etc. It is well known that nanoparticles are more efficient than their bulky counterpart. Therefore, instead of sulphur, nano-sulphur will be used against the pest which will be effective at very low concentration without leaving any residual toxicity.","There are many methods of synthesizing nano-sulphur from elemental sulphur like chemical precipitation, sonication etc. In the present study, nano-sulphur particles will be synthesized through ultrasonication promoted strategy. The synthesized nano-sulphur particles will be characterized by SEM, TEM and XRD. Then different concentrations of nanoparticles will be applied on mite infested leaves to assess the efficacy.    Objectives: i) To synthesize nano sulphur particles ii) To standardize concentration and delivery system of nano-sulphur iii) Management of yellow mites in different crops  ",Nano-pesticides are recent introduction into the pesticide market. Only very few nanoparticles are available in the market. Even their efficacy against various pests are not known.

Therefore, the idea is unique.    We aim to bring the convenience of paying the fare in autorickshaws by using NFC.    The system works using the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology and is being used in metro transportation across India. Therefore, we can easily say that the system is very reliable.   ","Our system will consist of two modules.  The NFC Card  RFID reading machine    The NFC Card  The NFC card will be issued to all the people who become part of our system.   The card can be used to pay for the fare in auto-rickshaws and private buses.   To pay, the customer just needs to tap once on the machine, very similar to   the way they do in the metro transport. And while exiting they tap on it again   and the fair will be automatically deducted from the wallet.    The RFID Machine  The RFID machine will be installed on the auto-rickshaws and later on private buses.   The cost of the machine will come out to be approximately 500rs when mass produced.    OBJECTIVE OF THE STARTUP  We want to make public transport more convenient for the common man.     The payment will take less than 1 second and will be much faster than the market-leading UPI.   Our ultimate goal is to make traveling across India cashless.    We aim to make public transportation safer and more reliable.    ","AUTO RICKSHAWS   We will be installing the machine on the auto-rickshaws by which the customer can pay using the TripPay card.    BUSES  After auto-rickshaws, we will be aiming to install our machine on private buses     USE OF DATA  The data that will be collected by our operations can be used to monitor the number of people driving auto-rickshaw/buses as their daily livelihood. This data can be used to optimize the transportation system.     PREVENTING OVERLOADING OF AUTO/BUS  With the help of the NFC card, we can monitor the number of taps that have taken place and find the number of people inside the auto-rickshaw or bus, if the number goes above a given limit, we can stop accepting new passengers, hence preventing overloading.    COLLABORATION WITH GOVERNMENT   Our goal is to make payments in India digital and for that, we will approach to collaborate with the Indian Government to make our payment system available in every corner of India.  ","The idea has a lot of market potential since we are coming with the idea of organizing the unorganized transport like auto-rickshaw and private buses.   NFC technology is currently used by the government in the metro system in India, which proves that the product has a lot of market potential.  According to a survey the percentage of people using public transport for work commute is approximately 18 percent.      Now if we include the people who travel for purposes other than work then we can easily say that the graph can touch the 40 mark. Which is approximately 550 million (55Cr) Indians.    And according to another estimation approximately 11Cr Indians travel by auto-rickshaw every day.  From the above statistics, we can easily say that our idea has a lot of market potential.

We have applied for a copyright design patent. It is a very unique product in the Indian Market.    ,"Solar tree has unique properties in terms of height and multi - angle orientation parameters. By employing the height parameter, solar tree requires less space consumption which can reduce the installation cost. Compared to the traditional solar farm which is oriented in a single direction, the multi-angle orientation parameter from the solar tree panels yields the potential capability to absorb higher sunlight intensity leading to higher output energy. At the same time, this parameter eliminates the necessity to install solar tracker which can reduce the operational cost. To increase the collection Generation of 1MW power from PV module system requires the land of 5-6 Acres approximately for housing the panels only. A tall pole-like structure would take only 1 of land area in comparison to general PV housing. In India there is scarcity of land in urban and even in rural areas. It can also be locked at any position to withstand the wind pressure due to heavy storm affecting over the main pole/ trunk. The panels will be naturally facing towards the sun at an angle as required so that they can collect maximum solar energy in a daytime. To get the maximum sun in a day time the top panel should not obstruct the bottom panels.","Solar Tree is an environmental enterprise, an ecological sculpture, an artificial solar structure that looks like sculptural trees and exists from small scale (size of a bonsai tree) to large scale (about the size of a wind turbine) power plant. It is an independent unit that produces green energy and provides a place of comfort and energy for a wide variety of services. The structure is ground mounted solar system with a pole that supports many individual panels up in the air. The aesthetics of solar trees differ and they have been designed to provide different means of power to different urban and built environments. It can be placed in residential areas and in urban areas, courtyards, schools and universities, parks and along hiking trails. It can also be placed in cultural institutions as an icon and a symbol of community,environment and green education.","Solar tree can be applicable in following fields  In the field of Golf courses and resorts  In Urban and Rural Areas  Applicable in Recreational parks, city parks In Penthouses, balconies, verandas  Private gardens  Applicable on Airports  In Mountainous regions  On Coastlines  Applicable on Highways  Applicable New housing estates  In Crop Protection  In De-forested areas.  In India, for instance, solar trees can contribute to fulfilling energy demand while saving space. The technology can ensure continuous supply of electricity in areas that do not have enough power supply and can benefit many who are not connected to the grid.","The idea has huge market potential.  It gives more solar power compared to conventional SPV layout consumes 1 of land surface for the same power.

In parallel the rise of disease among peoples are increased consistently among people. In India most of the people are from rural area with less educational competencies. They are unable to explain about their earlier health information when are affected by an disease. Also physician depends on paper work for getting patient information apart from few digital data8217s that are available only in few hospitals. Hence worth there is an urgent need for new technology to store and retrieve patient information quickly. The launches of NFC tags are implemented at hospitals for storing and accessing individual patient health information using deputed NFC writer. This system works in a swift basis that stored huge volume of patient health information and converts are link and finally stored in NFC tag. When a patient approaches a doctor their entire health information8217s are retrieved in a single tap and then parallel updated after the present diagnosis process is completed. NFC is the recent charm in technological growth and provides way for upgraded inventions in the field of medical sciences. ,"Maintaining patient health related documents at hospital is a tedious process. Generally, health documents hold patient information and supports very few health-related information due to security constraints. This is because of health data confidentiality. Despite using few health based MIS it doesn8217t not quench valid information8217s.1310Apart from the primary issues, the next issues come in the aspects of updated health information. As the periodic monitoring of patient8217s health improves patients8217 health and the timely health-based information is not maintained digitally. All such information as stored in patient health booklet manually by the physician. Storing information as hard copy has its own constraint and in case of missed documents none of the information can be retrieved.1310The working principles of NFC act a medium of holding information about patient. This is done using NFC writer. The NFC writer is linked the health cloud that holds overall information of all the patients at hospital. 1310Every health tag holds patients8217 information and it can be read by NFC reader that are kept at the physician desk. When a patient walks in, his entire health information8217s are read by a single tap made at NFC reader. The update information8217s are stored back to the tag. 1310",The concept of cloud is introduced with a help of a url link then holds individual patients health information. An Admin at hospital maintains this file and periodic updates are made then and there for updated health content.1310This cloud is accessed between one or more centers of the hospital that holds common health information of the patients and his information is available between systems of all hospitals center.1310Such approach reduces overall paper works that are used to hold health information and it8217s now available in the form of health tag.1310One of the modern-day revolutions in IT sector is cloud computing. This concept is based on data and resource sharing for successful implementation of cloud computing in an organization. In this concept the implementation of private and public health cloud is launched and the patient8217s health data are accessed using NFC tag and RFID card. RFID acts as a medium for storing patient8217s information and the information are then linked with NFC tag. The tag is accessed using specific designed readers put up at physician8217s end that are devised to accessed patient information in a single tap. The periodic health related information are keyed and stored in a system web form and are finally stored in cloud. The information that are fed into tag in the form of URL link. Each and every link has patient health information with timely updates. ,This invention is to implement NFC tag concepts for accessing patient health-based information from cloud store. The role of NFC tag is to stored and read patient health information using deputed NFC reader. The NFC writer writes the information in the form of URL in NFC tag that8217s stored patient information. 13101310Still there are people who are not able to explain their health problem especially their early medical reports. The present invention mainly deals with patient health information retrieval using NFC tag and reader/writer. This system works for the patients who are not in the proper mind set to explain about their health problem and also not able to monitor their early medical reports.  This system works for all but especially for the rural people who are not able to explain their health problem due to lack of education. As India has more villages this system gives a perfect value-added service in the field of medical science. 13101310Deputed NFC reader and writer are involved in this process with an admin who operated at physician locations.1310,Dr.S.Arun  Professor ECE PEC  Dr.S.PadmaPriya  Professor CSE PEF,"M.E., PhD",9962562307,We have implemented the NFC tag in the simulation model and tested and also tried with hospitals for storing and accessing individual patient health information using deputed NFC writer.

For example, an incandescent bulb with a power rating of 100 W generates roughly the same lumens as Light Emitting Diode (LED) with a power rating of 10 W. Further, the Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) requires DC input voltage. When the LEDs are operated on an AC grid, a down conversion of the AC voltage to a DC voltage has to take place and which results in a loss of energy. Similarly, there are fans, televisions and other equipment8217s that are operated on DC and these equipments operated on DC are far more efficient than that of their AC counter parts. Another issue is the currently available grid-connected and off-grid solar systems comprise a solar panel and an inverter that converts an energy generated by the solar panel from direct current (DC) to a grid compatible alternating current (AC). In the case of an off-grid system, a battery bank is charged by the panels to supply a power during the switching off period of the grid power. Hence, there is a need for an intelligent and energy efficient DC off-grid solar system and a method for generating solar energy to the end user equipment.  Also, there is need for a system and method for delivering DC energy to the household systems efficiently.","Design of circuit which consists of a relay communicatively coupled to the controller. The controller with help of voltage sensor identify required voltage signal. If sufficient voltage signal is not obtained through solar panel, then relay changes the input source from solar panel to grid. Now the electronic device retrieves the input from grid after step down and converts DC using a rectifier. 1310Following are the objectives:1310?9To design an automatic switching electronic system which takes input from solar panel and in absence of solar energy from grid.1310?9To design a switch controller circuit to obtain off-gird DC energy continuously.1310?9To design a switch controller circuit to operate multiple DC Appliances like Ceiling Fan, Table Fan, LEDs, LEDTV8217s and LEDMONITOR8217s, Laptop etc., in group or single. For these appliances Continuous DC energy is obtained through Solar Panel and in absence of Solar Energy through grid.","?9All schools, colleges, government offices, shops, industries, etc. working in daytime would be highly benefitted. 1310?9The proposed system provides energy which can be efficiently utilized by consumers where consumption of electricity is at a high rate in daytime. 1310?9Use of such a proposed system will approximately save 75 of energy which is consumed from AC Main or Grid-line.  This approach can be considered as energy conservation. ","1)This system can be used for every individual DC supply operated electronic appliance in the households and industries.2)Cost of the product is low and has good potential in the retail market.3)Use of this product will intensify the utilization of solar energy.4)Large number of electronic devices can accurately run on the proposed system thus reducing the heavy consumption of electricity provided by State electricity board at various public places like schools, colleges, universities, shops, offices, industries, etc. As result, the system reduces more than 75 of energy consumption obtained from the main Grid.","Dr. N N Kasat  Professor  Electronics and Telecommunication Department  Sipna College of Engineering and Technology, Amravati  ","Total Experience 22 Years and Qualification ME, PhD(Electronics Engg.)",9766309111,Literature review and design phase is completed. ,12 Months,"Power, Renewables, Electricals, Power Electronics, Energy Efficiency and any related sub-sector "

120,IDEATN003482,jegannathan r,TAMIL NADU,CHENNAI,"Aluminium-Air Battery Design, Fabrication and Testing",No,"In our project instead of using Li-ion in batteries, we have made the decision to use Aluminum as our main source. Aluminium batteries are better than their counterparts in terms of energy stored and energy produced, however, the drawback is that the corrosion rate of Aluminum is higher and the battery doesn8217t stop corroding even when it8217s not in use. This is why the current industry has only started testing this method recently. We have devised a way to stop this event up to a certain extent using the unique design of our Aluminum-Air battery and its compactness gives it a very practical approach that can be used in countless different situations. Our goal is to find a way to minimize the idle corrosion of the battery and increase its lifespan by using intelligent design simulations, additionally, in our prototype, we have the flexibility of changing the aluminium plates (anode) after it has been used/corroded completely and replacing it with new plates which avoid the task of disposing of the whole unit. This will ultimately prove to be environment friendly.","Our Concept provides us with the luxury to completely change the Aluminum Plates (Anode) without having to dispose of the whole unit where-in limiting the e-waste which has recently been a major issue in environmental conferences and international goals such as the SDGs (Sustainable development goals).1310Additionally, our prototype limits the corrosion of the Aluminum plates which tend to corrode even when they are not in use. With our design, we are using a physical barrier (cotton slate) which acts as the soaked electrolyte and makes contact between the Aluminum plates and the carbon mesh ultimately helping electrons to flow. This cotton slate is submerged into the electrolyte solution when the battery is idle, thus no contact is made between the plates and the carbon mesh which prevents the corrosion of the anode. Our objective is to make this Aluminum-Air battery ready for practical use and provide cheap, eco-friendly alternatives to existing technologies. 1310","With the current decline of fossil fuels, batteries are certainly going to be the replacement for it. Although lithium has been the go-to element for the production of batteries it does not come without its drawbacks such as depletion of the water table in the place of lithium mining, low charge density etc. Hence, with our innovation of an aluminium-air battery, we overcome those shortcomings and it can be used with the same versatility as lithium-ion batteries.","There can be potential demand for aluminium-air batteries due to the rise in demand for electric vehicles in the market since the aluminium-air batteries are reliable and have better characteristics when compared with the existing system and its parameters. The Aluminium-air battery mainly focuses on the Automotive sectors, Military, Consumer Electronics, Aerospace and others.

125,IDEATN003519,Sivaranjani G,TAMIL NADU,KANCHIPURAM,Saffron cultivation using assorted modern techniques,Our idea involves the usage of vertical gardening and hydroponics to cultivate saffron so that it can be cultivated widely in parts of India.Vertical gardening allows to grow more plant in small land area. Hydroponics helps reduce soilborne illness of saffron. ,"In this idea modern gardening methods such as vertical gardening and hydroponics system is used to cultivate saffron. Here saffron is cultivated in a polyhouse setup where temperature and moisture can be maintained used artificially created mist. By this idea saffron can be cultivated widely in many places in our country. The Greenhouse Fogging System is also known as the misting system. It ensures that the moisture level remains at an optimal level for the photosynthesis required for plant growth. Misting systems use high pressure nozzles to form fine water droplets to cool the greenhouse. Pumped into the air, the tiny mist droplets remain suspended until they evaporate. Fog systems can be installed in any greenhouse configuration, such as  with natural or mechanical ventilation. Greenhouses equipped with exhaust fans also have very  good fog cooling capabilities. A line of mist nozzles is installed right inside the exhaust fan. The exhaust fan on the opposite wall draws outside air through the open vents and then through the fog, where the air is cooled.

Patent application no. is 202221009936,"The field of the invention for the proposed work is for cleaning the fan blades of a ceiling fan. Cleaning devices of many shapes and sizes have been created for handling a variety of needs. Currently, there are no devices that allow a user to clean ceiling fan blades without the use of a ladder, step stool, or other elevating devices. ","Concept:  1310The present invention relates to cleaning devices and, more specifically, to a device that allows a user to clean both the top and bottom of a ceiling fan blade without the need for an elevating device of any kind. The invention may be adapted to work with a wide variety of 10 blade types, shapes, and sizes. It is the purpose and objective of the present invention to provide an improved means for safely cleaning both the tops and bottoms of ceiling fan blades without the need for ladders, step stools, or other elevating devices. It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a cleaning device for ceiling blades that will not, in any way, damage the blade, its finish, or fan mechanism through normal use. It is yet another feature and objective of the present invention to provide a one-piece cleaning cover that is easily installed for cleaning or removed for replacement. 13101310Objective: The main objectives of our innovative idea is:1310a)9To provide economic and efficient solutions for the  ceiling fan cleaning process.1310b)9To develop easy to operate and portable device. 1310c)9To improve to clean and eco-friendly environment in hospitals and government office.1310d)9To reduce the kati shoola or kati graham and considered to be an imbalance or vikrati in human body.1310e)9To provide comfort during cleaning of ceiling fan.1310","Ceiling type fans are extensively used in dwellings, offices and many other types of buildings to circulate air and reduce the cost of heating during cold weather and air-conditioning during hot weather. The blades of such fans, particularly on the top surfaces, become encrusted with a layer of dust that clings tenaciously to the blade surface and must be removed from time to time to maintain the full effective operation of the ceiling fan. In a conventional method of cleaning ceiling fans, a person will stand on a ladder or stool so the blades can be reached and then cleaned with a cloth or brush. Because such cleaning operations are so arduous to perform, a majority of ceiling fan blades remain uncleaned or are not cleaned nearly as often as needed. 1310The potential areas of given product are household appliances, hospitals, offices and whenever cleaning is required.","There are currently several varieties of apparatus for cleaning ceiling fans. Many of these have disadvantages for cleaning the upper surface of the ceiling fan blades, forcing the user to use a ladder or stool to reach the upper blade surfaces. Other cleaning tools require bulky vacuums or attachments which limit reach and mobility. None of these inventions gives the user a view of the top side of the ceiling fan blade being cleaned. Most of these inventions use a wiping or sweeping method with a fixed brush or cleaning surface to remove dust from the top side of the ceiling fan blade.1310The field of invention for the proposed work is for cleaning the fan blades of a ceiling fan. Cleaning devices of many shapes and sizes have been created for handling a variety of needs. Currently, there are no devices that allow a user to clean ceiling fan blades without the use of a ladder, step stool, or other elevating devices. 1310This project is having a wide scope in an organization like colleges, schools, corporate offices, government offices, hospitals, restaurants, hotels and households etc. Almost everywhere when cleanliness is required.1310Since our idea is to clean a ceiling fan, which is a new concept in the market.

131,IDEATS003551,Nagul Shribala,TELANGANA,HYDERABAD,Battery Management System,No,"Electric vehicles are set to be the dominant form of transportation in the near future and Lithium-based rechargeable battery packs have been widely adopted in them. Battery packs need to be constantly monitored and managed in order to maintain the safety, efficiency and reliability of the overall electric vehicle system. A battery management system consists of a battery fuel gauge, optimal charging algorithm, and cell/thermal balancing circuitry. It uses three non-invasive measurements from the battery, voltage, current and temperature, in order to estimate crucial states and parameters of the battery system, such as battery impedance, battery capacity, state of charge, state of health, power fade, and remaining useful life. These estimates are important for the proper functioning of optimal charging algorithms, charge and thermal balancing strategies, and battery safety mechanisms.","A BMS can measure different figures such as current, voltage, temperature, and coulomb count. With these measurements the system can assess the health of the battery and readjust operations as needed to protect the pack. For instance, a drop in cell voltage at a given load can indicate an increase in internal resistance. This then can point toward dry-out, corrosion, plate separation, or other diagnoses. A sudden increase in the temperature of one cell could indicate the possibility of a thermal runaway event within the whole battery pack. The BMS could then stop the flow of energy and alert the user to a potential problem so that it can be contained before it gets out of control. State of charge (SoC) and state of health (SoH) are important indicators for assessing the usability and capabilities of a battery. Together the SoC and SoH provide a state of function, an overview of the battery and the pack8217s capabilities as a whole.1310The proposed BMS is Bluetooth enabled/WiFi enabled. The battery voltage/ current, temperature is monitored. There is a provision of High and Low voltage protection. A monitor to display the range of voltages. The system also estimates SoC and SoH. The power is limited at input/output for thermal and over voltage protection, control battery charging profile and when ever required the battery pack may be isolated from source and load.  1310","The potential areas of application are Industrial machines, Electric train traction batteries, forklifts, garbage compressors, , lifts and cranes, robots, shuttle robots, electric street sweepers. Advantages:131082269Ensure that the battery is in good working order.131082269Battery health is continuously monitored to avoid an explosion.131082269Extends the battery8217s life expectancy.131082269Displays the battery level13101310","Governments across the globe have implemented stringent regulations and policies, to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, rise in awareness regarding harmful effects of petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles on the environment has led to innovations in the automotive industry in the form of electric and hybrid vehicles. Moreover, growth in consumer demand to maximize vehicle efficiency and minimize fuel costs have led to consistent technological advancements in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. The need to optimize utilization of battery storage capacity in electric vehicles and to prevent dangers caused by overheating of battery in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, manufacturers have started to integrate battery management systems in vehicles.

Our innovation reuses the available Cloud Storage for storing the data and we also make use of the Global Navigation Satellite System which to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning Coordinates which are essential features for our prototype.So we have integrated it our project.  ,"An Electrical Detection System is developed in order to Protect Pedestrians from getting Electrocuted Due to the Snapped Power Line Submerged under pooled stormwater on a narrow street. Safety circuitry of distribution company is inadequate due to this line remains live with broken wires. Along with this bursting of transformers, shut downing of power supply were also occurs frequently in remote areas.  So, a safety prevention system could be developed which continuously monitors the state of the transmission power supply lines and executes the circuit breakage system if the transmission lines get cutoff. The main approach here is to determine the continuity of the transmission lines. we are using two different integrated systems with voltage sensing modules and other discrete components to ensure the continuity of the transmission of the cable. we also use two sharp infrared sensors to detect the birds perching on the transmission lines and driving away those birds once got detected using the buzzer sound. we use a circuit breakage system in order to cutoff the supply voltage from the transformer to the supply cable once the transmission cables breaks. This prevents pedestrians from getting electrocuted by the snapped power lines. We also use a GPS SOS alert system which alerts the respective areas electric board members, so that they can able to reach the destination as soon as possible to rectify the problem created in the power lines.","Our aim is to reduce the inadequacy of the existing methodology and make the whole system completely autonomous. We have modern technologies like A.I, IoT, GNSS to make the complete process an automated one. We divided the entire system into smaller subtasks and make the whole process a flawless one. We had minimal usage of mechanical system(Hydraulic Pistons) for shutting down the transformer ,which greatly reduces the cost of implementation and installation . Along with this bursting of transformers, shut downing of power supply were also occurs frequently in remote areas. So, a safety prevention system could be developed which continuously monitors the state of the transmission power supply lines and executes the circuit breakage system if the transmission lines get cutoff. 30 people die in India everyday due to the electric shock from the falling electric poles. It not only costs on the people8217s lives but also impacts on the economy hugely. Around 86 billion is lost due to power failures across India and most of it is due to the transmission failures in electric poles. We tend to decrease it with the help of our idea and thereby contributing both to economy as well as to the nation. The main objective of this entire project is to provide a highly efficient, stable and economical solution that prevents the humans from getting electrocuted by the broken transmission lines.  ","The Indian power and distribution transformer market is anticipated to witness continued growth over the forecast period owing to government initiatives to boost the electrification rate and uplift operational efficiency. The India Power  Distribution Transformer Market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 3.0 during 2020-26. The government is taking major steps to strengthen the power transmission  distribution network and has undertaken initiatives like searching for new advanced technologies that provide sufficient power through transmission lines without any tragedies.

We are going to analyse waste generated in Islampur city. As per results obtained we are proceeding further. Then we are going to preparation of model to carry out pyrolysis process. The product obtained will be in impure form which is like a diesel. After its further purification, we are getting petrol as a product. On the basis of result we are going to design Refused Derived Fuel System for Islampur City. ","India generates close to 26,000 tonnes of plastic a day, most of which is single use plastic. Most of it goes in dumping grounds around cities. Dumping ground around the metro city and developing cites are getting bigger day by day. Need of the hour is to create awareness regarding use and disposable of plastic and controlling plastic pollution and simultaneously cleaning the landfill of plastic. Due to decomposing of the food and natural matter Methane gas is produced in the dumping ground area. Islampur city is growing city with great increasing rate of population, generates total waste of 25tonnes per day. In that 6.72tonnes is dry waste out of which 0.5tonnes is plastic waste. Islampur city has solid waste plant near Islampur-Junekhed Road, Taluka Walwa, District Sangli, Maharashtra, India. Plant has area of 16 acres.  Due to some the reasons disposal of waste is not happening and nearly 15acres of land filled with the waste since last 4 years or even before that composting of wet waste is only done. There is number of heaps of waste dumped on site without any treatment. Data obtained from Mr. Aditya Chavan (municipal authority) and Mr. Ashok Hubale (Solid waste plant operater). To, overcome the problem and achieve environmental sustainability, necessity of the proposed work.","The pyrolysis is a complex process in which the different type of plastic is heated to higher temperature about 300ºC to 500ºC in absence of oxygen. At this high temperature, thermal cracking of the plastic start. After a period of time the plastic is melted down and steam is formed. This steam is condensed in the condenser with help of catalyst. Post condensation the output of the plant is in liquid, char and gas. Using pyrolysis, we can reduce plastic waste problem and provide an alternative fuel for local industrial application. Also, in this process create opportunity for employment in sub-urban and rural regions. Plastic waste collected is not same for all batch, so temperature cannot be specified for pyrolysis process. Pyrolysis Batch timing is ideally of 18 to 20 hours.1310Objectives: 13101.9To analyze municipal solid waste.13102.9To define scope of refused derive fuel. 13103.9Alternatives of refused derive fuel. 13104.9Design of refused derive fuel system for Islampur City.     1310","Wherein 80 of the plastic can be reused in some or the other form. 50 of plastic used in daily commute is single used plastic.

The fuel which is produced from plastic pyrolysis can be used as alternative fuel for industrial application which will benefit small and micro industrials around India. Coal and wood is not preferred in most industries due to the carbon and smoke emission, depletion of forest and limitation of natural resources. This calorific value of the pyrolysis fuel is twice of the coal and wood. Further distilling of this pyrolysis fuel can give a fuel grade equivalent to jet fuel.

Need of the hour is to create awareness regarding use and disposable of plastic and controlling plastic pollution and simultaneously cleaning the landfill of plastic. Due to decomposing of the food and natural matter Methane gas is produced in the dumping ground area. Natural or manmade fires in dumping ground, ignites the methane gas and plastic acts as fuel in dumping ground. The burning of plastics releases toxic gases like dioxins, furans, mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls. Therefore a proper way of disposing plastic is need as fast, economical and efficient as possible. Humans are the only factor in environment which consume plastic at such Hugh quantity and we are massively depended on plastic in our daily commute. It is impossible to stop using plastic immediately. When speaking about benefiters in this process are almost everyone who uses plastic in direct or indirect manner.

It has cameras and sonic waves generator to distract the birds, reptiles and animals from the crop field without causing harm to them.","This system uses an effective device to avoid both animals and birds intruding in the land by generating various alert sounds for different kind of animals and birds. When the same output is repeated for a specific time period, it generates the sonic shield waves which drives away the animals and birds, meanwhile the alert message will also be sent to the farmers mobile number.","The animal/ birds intrusion into the agricultural land is detected by using video surveillance system. The outputs generated by video surveillance system will be transferred to the ARDUINO micro controller and the signal obtained is compared with the animal/ birds database through image processing techniques. Based on the output, frightening sounds to distract birds/animals and making them to move away from the farming land are generated from the sound sensor.

The problem in with such modules is that, the cost of these products is too huge because the sensor modules have to be distributed all over the agriculture land. The existing systems dont actually consider any inputs, and cost about Rs 44, 000 for manual control Thus a majority of our farmers will not be able to afford it. The other problem with existing systems is that sensors are battery operated and once the sensor fails the module has to be replaced.

The main thing about the filter bulb is regenerative filter Bulb so every time you do not need to but the filter bulb it is regenerative. A very low cost solution for the waste water recycling at domestic level. ","Objective - Provide a low-cost compact sustainable solution for the Domestic level to recycle the waste water. According to NITI AAyog  Report. Water scarcity is going to be major problem in India. As we know, water can not be created but recycled.  Broadly, water crisis can be divided in scarcity of water and deliberate waste water discharge which in turn pollutes the fresh water streams. In the household around 80 percent water is used for the secondary purposes like bathing, flushing and cleaning etc. and 20 percent water is used for the drinking and cooking purposes. This 80 percent water is after uses go wastage in drainage and pollute to our mother rivers. So this waste water is creating 2 problems water scarcity and river pollution. Product working  concept - We have used water level sensor to on off the water pump. When the water will use even this system will automatically  on. This water will go to the filtration unit where solid impurities will trapped by natural sponge layer of 30 PPI. The this water will go to the next layer of filter bulb here the activated carbon will be in a pores layer so again solid impurities will be trapped and due to pores the surface area of layer will be increased so it will increases the absorbing capacity and easy for the backwashing. Then this water will passed to solid layer of activated Carbon here the rating of this layer is 5 micron so here all the colour , odor and other chemical impurities will be absorbed.

156,IDEATN003742,KANNAN M,TAMIL NADU,TIRUNELVELI,DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF DUAL AXIS MULTI-PURPOSE SOLAR TRACKER FOR HEAVY SOLAR COLLECTORS,No this is a new idea it does not involve any intellectual property.,"Most of the currently available tracker designed to hold the mounting system itself connected to rotating shaft and  a drive system for this complex loading. Such system is suitable for low weight solar collector like PV panels. However, application like solar dryer are heavy and bulky. These systems require a tracker system that handle heavy loads. The handling such heavy and large size system need a tracker that separate the load from the collector and transfer directly to the grounding structure. This will free the tracker drive system from heavy load traction.  This will ease the operation and control of the tracker. An arch-roller tracker is one of the solutions for the above problem and have high commercial value.  A arch- roller tracker system is a mechanism that isolate the tracking and load bearing to handle heavy solar collector.  Isolation of tracker drive unit independent of load bearing/load carrying function. ","The solar trackers are rising in popularity and solar panel tracking solutions are a more advanced technology for monitoring photovoltaic panels. However, they are not being used to its potential, even in solar power plants, due to drawbacks like low load bearing capacity of the existing system design. The tracker system are also least used in rooftop mounting of solar panels. Similarly, the solar tracker usage is very little in commercial solar drying solutions. The dryer or other collector are usually heavy, bulky and large in size. Henceforth its difficult to adopt the existing tracker system for these applications. The heavy and large size system need a tracker that separate the load from the collector and transfer directly to the grounding structure. This will free the tracker drive system from heavy load traction.  This will ease the operation and control of the tracker. A arch-roller tracker is one of the solution for the above problem and have high commercial value.  The objectives are    To design a system that tracks the sunlight for solar panels and increase efficiency and accuracy than other solar tracking system.   To design a commercially viable arch-roller type tracker system for heavy load commercial solar dryer and solar panels with an operational mode of fully automatic, semi-automatic and or manual. The arch-roller tracker mechanism is used to isolate the tracking and load bearing to handle heavy solar collector. ","The dual axis arch type solar tracker can be used in place of existing solar trackers in PV panel mountings. Apart from this, the arch-roller tracker is easily adoptable for rooftop PV panel mounting. 1310The potential application of arch-roller tracker are mounting of heat collector of solar dryer used in vegetable, fruits nuts and other many agriculture produce drying. the solar dryers are dominantly used for fish drying. This tracker will be easily adoptable for the industrial sector solar heaters and desalination plants.13101310So, the Solar Tracker found usage in Roof Top solar panel, Solar power plant, Agriculture solar dryers, solar fish dryers, solar heater, desalination plant and solar Agri-tillage vehicles.13101310The azimuth and tilt rotation of this dual axis arch-roller tracker will be useful in solar based agriculture locomotives used for tillage, watering, seed spreading and pesticide spraying need directional changes to cover the land area. the fixed support solar panels is very low efficient due to the frequent directional change. adoption of arch-roller tracker will come handy in this situation to improve the energy harvest and reduce the panel size.","The rooftop solar panel has no solution for tracking and the proposed arch-roller tracker has huge market in Roof Top solar panel installation. Agriculture solar dryers, solar fish dryers, solar heater, desalination plant and solar Agri-tillage, fertilizer, pesticide vehicles.

157,IDEAMH003746,Sunil Kulbhushan Sahuji,MAHARASHTRA,AURANGABAD,Device for atraumatic removal of dental crowns and bridges,"The proposed device is designed on the principle of long axis. In order to remove the said crowns and bridges atraumatically, the device works along the direction of paths of removal of the crowns and bridges which are exactly opposite to the direction of path of insertions of the said crowns and bridges.  The concept has been applied for Indian Patent (Patent No: 201921033764  Published- The Patent Office Journal No. 13/2021 Dated 26-03-2021), and The USA patent (application No: US17/762513 applied on 22-03-2022).   The Indian Patent Office and WIPO-PCTs written opinion of the international searching authority have accepted all the 17 claims made, under Novelty and Industrial applicability steps. For the step of patentability, the raised concerns (D1, D2) have been answered appropriately. ","At present, there are 2 methods of removing crowns and bridges:  1. By using crown removers (Goldfinch Dental Crown Remover, Waldent Automatic Spring loaded Crown Remover):  Till today, 90 of the instruments used in India as crown removers do not have any scientific principle of working. Most of the time they are unpredictable, prone to produce accidental injuries to the surrounding soft tissues and the underlying abutment teeth like fracture of the teeth, or even complete avultion of them. In spite of so many disadvantages, these instruments are still in use because they are cheaper and there is no any predictable, scientifically designed, dedicated device in the market.   2. By cutting the crowns and bridges:  When a clinician feels that the removal of crowns and bridges  by using the above mentioned crown removers is not possible or when they anticipate fracture or injury, most of the clinicians prefer to cut down the crowns and bridges through and through by using air rotors and diamond cutting burs to avoid fracture or other type of injuries. In these cases, the removed crowns and briges gets damaged totally and their reuse in the same patient after the retreatment of the said teeth is not possible and the clinician has to refabricate the crowns or bridges which is time consuming, expensive and unnecessarily increases the cost of the treatment to the patients.    ","Concept: Every tooth in the oral cavity is fixed in the alveolar bone of the maxillary and the mandibular jaws. An imaginary vertical line passing through the center of the tooth and the center of the tip of the root is called as the long axis of the tooth which makes a specific acute or obtuse angle with the horizontal and the vertical planes. While preparing a tooth for crowns and bridges, a clinician has to prepare the teeth by considering these long axes of the teeth. After making an impression of the prepared teeth, crowns and bridges are constructed in the dental laboratories and are to be inserted and cemented over the teeth in a specific path called as path of insertion. So, if we want to remove these crowns and bridges from the teeth, they have to be removed by the application of controlled and balanced force exactly in the opposite direction called as path of removal. If the force is applied in any other directions than their path of removal, it may result into fracture of the underlying natural teeth structures.    Objectives:  To remove the crowns and bridges smoothly, without damaging the underlying natural teeth structure, surrounding tissues and without causing pain or injury to the patient.  To remove the crowns and bridges in lesser time (few seconds to minutes) in order to save the working time.  ",This device is the primary and basic device required to be used in any retreatment cases. Every dental surgeon have to perform retreatments. So it will be requirement of every dental surgeon. This device will be used in all the dental colleges and in research and academic,"At present, more than 3 lakh dental surgeons are practicing in India.   We have more than 300 dental colleges with the intake capacity of more than 30000 students every year.  In coming 20 years time, the total number of practitioners in India may reach up to 6-7 lakhs.  This is a very huge market to cater.

E,RAJASTHAN,JODHPUR,Developing Endoscope Socket to provide uninterpreted endoscopic visual field to ENT doctor for diagnosing patients with minimal discomfort.,"The Novelty of the proposed coating is developing a socket-based Anti-Fogging lens coating, which directly fits the existing scopes. The sterilizable socket-based Anti-Fogging solution will help perform more lengthy diagnostics procedures while reducing the cost burden on patients. The improved functionality with a coating of functional materials and Design Novelty of the socket will enable the product to be patented.Relevant Patent to proposed solution  JP2008006228, Anti-Fogging Socket for Endoscope, Jichi Medical Univ.

CN111077600, Lens Glass, Endoscope and Treatment Method of Lens Glass, Chongqing ","Innovations like optic fibers, wide-angle camera lenses, navigation assistance, and other technology are developed to enhance these scopes functionality. Yet, several unaddressed problems deteriorate the picture quality, like endoscope angle, inefficient cleaning, lens soiling, and fogging. The compromised picture quality increases the chances of error, thus reducing the diagnostics efficacy. The common problem that drastically affects the scopes visual quality is lens fogging.1310The products and services available in the market provide an Anti-Fog effect are surfactant-based repelling water molecules by forming a low-energy surface on the lens. The surfactant-based solution will produce a temporary effect, inefficient in performing lengthy procedures and degrades the quality of the scopes over time. The problem can be effectively addressed by developing a permanent Anti-Fogging coating, which will form a thin water molecule on the surface, providing a transparent film under fogging maintaining the visual quality. This will aid the doctors in performing the diagnosis without intervention resulting in better patient comfort. The uniqueness of the proposed coating is developing a socket-based Anti-Fogging lens coating, which directly fits on the existing scopes. The socket is transparent, biocompatible and sterilizable to help perform more lengthy diagnostics procedures with less cost burden to patients. ","Lens fogging occurs due to the temperature imbalance between the front lens and the airway cavity. The problem is severe in the case of ENT diagnosis, as more effort and time are required to reach the designated location. If the lens gets fogged in the middle of a procedure, the doctor has no other option than to remove the endoscope from the patient and start again. This dramatically increases patient discomfort and work fatigue of doctors. 1310Solution1310The proposed Polymer based coating will reduce water molecules surface tension and force them to spread into a thin film. The scopes will maintain the visual quality as the light can pass through these thin films with minimal distortion. The Anti-fogging test is evaluated in a lab setup under various temperature and humidity conditions to understand its performance. The socket based product will be subjected to mechanical damage tolerance and autoclave sterilization cycles for reusability. 1310Objectives 13101.9Achieving a minimum of 95 of initial glass Transparency with coating.13102.9Retaining Anti-Fogging effect for minimum of 10 minutes.13103.9Producing a glass socket for placing the Anti-fogging glass on the endoscope.13104.9Imparting re-usability with a minimum of ten procedures under autoclave sterilization.","Rural India accounts for 70 of the total Indian Population amidst the economic development and population influx to urban areas.

However, HPLC and Preparative chromatography techniques have been well known. But these techniques have never been developed for the unexplored novel raw material AWL. We have developed the HPLC method and We have employed different separation techniques in a non obvious way. Various membranes, resins which others have not used elsewhere for such applications have been tested and employed. Also, the developed process is novel and have not been used elsewhere. We have filed the complete specification patent for the developed process. ","Most of the Indian companies such as Food  Beverages, Cosmetics, Nutraceuticals, Pharmaceuticals, etc., intend to manufacture a variety of their products using intermediate molecules such as EGCG, Catechins, etc., have been importing them from various Chinese and other Countries. These companies isolate such molecules from a cheap raw material using harsh chemicals that not only depict a low-grade purity product but also introduces carcinogens from the solvents used to isolate them, which is both detrimental to human health and also to the environment. Along with this, Indian companies are bound to pay the import duties while importing them from other countries which will add more cost to the industries which use them in the manufacturing line.1310Green tea or Acacia Catechu are not the only sources that are abundant in EGCG catechins. We have Arecanut as an alternate source that can be explored for the isolation of such molecules. 1310Fortunately, we have identified the areca nut wash liquid(AWL) which was unexplored until we did. AWL is obtained through boiling the areca nuts in water, a traditional method followed by the farmers from centuries old. 1310The presence of the molecules has been confirmed by simple preliminary phytochemical analysis and also by analytical HPLC. The amount of these molecules present in the raw material is abundant and this has helped us to develop a novel chromatographic separation and purification of molecules which can be completely scalable t","We add value to the AWL by applying in-house developed bioseparation processes. We employ downstream separation techniques such as Cross Flow Filtration and Chromatographic techniques to purify the antioxidant molecules according to the industry standards. 1310The raw material, i.e. Arecanut Wash Liquid contains a mixture of molecules ranging from Polyphenols, Sugars, Proteins, Alkaloids, Tannins, Minerals, micro and macronutrients. 1310By the application of the above-mentioned separation techniques, we are able to selectively purify the polyphenols from the raw material with a purity ranging from 80-98. 1310Also, with the application of in-house developed Ion exchange chromatography we are able to separate Arecoline, alkaloid found exclusively in areca nut. This alkaloid is a central nervous system stimulant and has potential application in the treatment of CNS-related disorders.1310","Our customer segment is mainly composed of industries. Industries such as Food  Beverages, Nutraceuticals, Cosmetics, Pharmaceuticals, Dye Intermediaries, etc., make use of these antioxidant molecules in the manufacturing of their final products. 1310The application of these antioxidants in the above-mentioned industries is because of the properties they exhibit such as preservatives, anti-obesity, anti-hypertensive, anti-aging, skin brightening, etc.1310But the market is mainly concentrated with the distributor chain for these molecules. Our main target is the distributors for marketing our products through the B2B channel.1310The Total addressable Market (TAM) globally is around 160 millions. The Serviceable Addressable Market is estimated to be 80-100 million considering we cater the APAC region out of which 20 million is concentrated in India. The Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) is 5-7 millions.1310India alone consumes around 1000 Tons of Catechin and 600 tons of EGCG. There is always a demand of Arecoline in the US and European market. Hence, our statistics are defendable and achievable as there are no producers of these molecules in higher purities such as 85 and above.1310","The major competitors being the Chinese companies. To name some of the Chinese companies that manufacture EGCG polyphenols in bulk are Hunan Sunfull, Novanat, Taiyo Green Power, Chengdu Wagott, Hunan Nutramax, etc. Some of the Indian companies those import these molecules on a large scale are: Unicorn Natural Products, Sami Labs, Phytotech extracts, Green Chem, Natural Remedies, Givaudan, Dynadis Biotech India etc. These companies import the low purity antioxidants and they use solvent-based extraction to isolate/purify the antioxidants.13101310The competitive advantage being, we are able to purify the antioxidants from a rich source that is natively available and in large quantity which helps us not to depend solely on green tea for the extraction of EGCG polyphenols. We employ chromatography-based separation which is highly selective and yields us better purity compounds that not only eliminate the use of harsh solvents but are also cost-effective.

Our goal is to reduce the environmental damage that is caused by the improper disposal of packaging materials on the planet. We are a product based company actively focusing on developing sustainable packaging materials using agriculture waste and mycelium, which is nothing but the roots of mushrooms, especially of edible ones, which are not only harmless but also have the potential to replace the extensive use of Petroleum-based foams, Plastic, and Cardboards. These packaging materials available in the market never degrade and are consumed in massive amounts leading to different environmental hazards like pollution, deforestation causing loss of vegetation and biodiversity leading to global warming.13101310We are working on a concept that is very unique. And the novelty involved in this is the technology of growing mycelia and the product design, that we are using is a patentable mould design that enhances the growth of the mycelia in 7 days, where the competitors are taking 16-21 days to grow the final product. Our faster technology also reduces the consumption of resources which will also reflect in the cost of the final product.1310","Our approach towards sustainability is to design mycelium-based packaging better and more intelligently. The intelligent design of products and materials is a prerequisite for developing packaging materials that are 100 Bio-Based, completely bio-degradable, home compostable, and eco-friendly. Our products consume minimal use of our planets finite resources. Mycelium, due to its natural self-assembling property, can be grown into any geometry. Hence, we can design and can have our product grown into any desired shape and size within a short span. Our strategy is to use easily available cheap substrates like paddy straw, rice husk, and hardwoods as raw material, and we grow our in-house filamentous mycelial strains of Pleurotus ostreatus, Trametes versicolor, and Ganoderma. This strategy is going to bring down our final product cost where we will be able to compete with our competitors. We are using a patentable mould design that enhances the growth of the mycelia. We at large scale will be using automated technologies to fasten the process of production, so we will be able to fulfill huge orders.1310","We propose to solve problems that are caused by improper disposal of packaging material. These packaging materials are causing enormous pollution and deforestation leading to loss of vegetation and loss of biodiversity. Our product is eco-friendly which will not cause any of these problems.

Hence, a faulty cell is found before it becomes a hazard. Large Battery Packs used in EVs use a central Electrical Control Unit (ECU). Our BMS uses Controller Area Network(An industry standard in automobiles) to transfer the battery information to the EVs central computer. Large EVs can have more than  600V battery voltage. We are using optically isolated CAN transceivers to safely transfer data to the ECU. We use switching converters to efficiently balance the cells (Active balancing) so that all cells in battery pack remain at same voltage without generating heat as in resistive balancing.  We use successive sampling of each cell, such that our ARM based STM32 microcontroller uses its ADC channels for sampling voltage of each cell. Individual Resistive voltage divider is provided for each cell. Each cell is sampled one by one.  We are using a advanced IC which uses switching controller which efficiently balance the cells.  The CAN transceivers use a galvanically isolated port to transfer data safety from high voltage battery packs.  High performance ARM based 32bit microcontroller monitors battery data and perform calculations like number of charge/discharge cycles, Coulomb counting, battery health, charge/discharge capacity, temperature monitoring, overvoltage, overcurrent, under voltage conditions using Back to Back N-Channel MOSFETs.","To create a quality, standard, safe and feature rich Battery Management System for the coming EV revolution involving latest technology while keeping the system affordable.","This product will aim at OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturers) of Large Battery Packs, Electric Vehicle Manufacturers, High Capacity energy storage in Non-Conventional Energy storage like Solar Power Plants, Lithium Based Un-interruptible Power Supplies.","Unlike the battery packs available in market now, our product will focus on standardization, quality, long life and safety as large battery packs can get hazardous without Battery Management System supervision.

182,IDEAKR004062,Rudra Nath Ghosh,KARNATAKA,UDUPI,Production of Mesenchymal stem cell-laden hydrogel dressing (Derma-heal) for wound management.,"The patent filed by Regenco Innovation Private Limited for A formulation of biocompatible and degradable fabricating material for 3D bioprinting Patent Application No: 202141054685, which will be used as a hydrogel matrix to support the growth of stem cell line within the dressing system that would be used as an advanced dressing material for wound coverage for pre-clinical and clinical trials. Other than this no outsourced patent material or process will be used for the product development.","Wound management requires specific external factors along with proper dressing material for proper healing of wound bed. The innovation in this project relies on the development of a hydrogel sheet containing cell-laden allogenic Mesenchymal Stem Cells to promote active wound healing and wound closure in traumatic wound. Hydrogel provides a moist environment around the wound site which is ideal for extensive healing for both exudating and necrotic wounds.  The role of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in wound healing has a promising outcome and has been researched extensively in the last few decades. Moreover, allogeneic-MSCs have been shown to evade immune rejection by the host as they express very low levels of MHC class I, no MHC class II and do not induce activation of allogeneic lymphocytes. It also has greater regenerative and wound closure properties than other skin cell types like fibroblast and keratinocyte by inducing re-epithelization and angiogenesis. 1310Biological wound coverage materials contain cells like fibroblast and keratinocytes embedded in scaffolds trigger immune reaction. Our, proposition to establish wound coverage with hydrogel-laden allogenic MSCs that would provide a breakthrough in the treatment and management of traumatic and deep wounds. The value that we propose are development indigenous cell-laden wound dressing product to replace acellular dressing faster healing time a perfect replacement model for autografts/skin-flaps.","An ideal wound coverage should provide a moist, clean, environment, provide hydration, protect from infection, and additionally provide wound healing and tissue regeneration.  Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) possess the ability to differentiate into definitive cell types such as keratinocyte and fibroblasts and exhibit cell migration, angiogenesis, promote epithelialization, and granulation tissue formation, altogether resulting in accelerated wound closure. They are hypoimmunogenic as they do not express class I and II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and co-stimulatory proteins (e.g., CD40, CD80, CD86).  Therefore, transplantation of allogeneic MSC has a low risk of immune rejection. The use of hydrogel to deliver MSCs into the wound area and its regenerative properties are exciting and highly promising new areas of research. This modality may even be a precursor for treatment of regeneration of other tissue types such as bone and cartilage.  In our project, we will focus on developing a wound dressing with allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell-laden biocompatible hydrogel that has the potential to incorporate onto the body and accelerate and optimize healing and even potentially become a substitute for autologous skin grafts. Our first objective will be proceeded with in-vivo rat study with isolation of rat MSCs incorporated in hydrogel and then further move forward towards clinical trials with isolation of Human MSCs.","The Indian wound care management market is expected to rise at a steady growth of 6.2 CAGR from the period 2021 8211 2027.  In India, around 7 million people suffer from burn injuries each year with 1.4 lakh deaths and 2.4 lakh people suffering from a disability. Over 10 lakh people are moderately or severely burnt every year. This requires the regeneration of the whole skin structure, multi-layers with each having specialized cells, appendages, and other components. Current skin substitute includes standard surgical therapies such as flap coverage and surgical debridement removal of unhealthy tissue from a wound to promote partial healing depending on the type and extent of the burn. A large burnt area or with a severe degree of damage, it is hard to restore the entire skin integrity or it takes a long time to recover the entire skin. Skin transplantation could be another method to treat burn patients, but waiting for the perfect skin match of the donor and the recipient takes a very long time. Hence there is a need to develop an alternative technique to replace the traditional skin substitute. 1310Allogenic MSC-laden hydrogel dressing can accelerate the wound healing procedure and has a promising effect on tissue repair and regenerative properties. This helps in providing a cover of the wound bed from external infection, a moist environment for wound healing, and a re-epithelialization process accelerated by MSCs.","The advanced wound care management market of India is estimated to be valued at US 227.2 million in 2020 and is expected to exhibit a CAGR of 5.5 during the forecast period (2020-2027). With up to 1 - 2 lakh people succumbing to death and disability due to lack of wound management there is a proper need for wound care products that are cheap and easily available to the customers. The imported advanced wound dressing products are high in cost and certainly lack cellular complexity. In the current scenario, around 100 to 150 skin clinics and major hospitals are actively participating in wound management with more than 10 lakhs people requiring adequate dressing for wound healing. If we are able to provide our wound dressing solution to 10 percent of the active wound management market our total market size will be estimated at around 10 - 15 crore rupees in revenue per year. With the growing wound management market, we can grow further within the next 5 to 10 years to 100 crore revenue providing effective wound management solutions to a major share of skin clinics and hospitals.","1.

Fabrication of anodic and cathodic electrode materials for this asymmetric hybrid capattery is based on mixed multi-transition metal oxyhydroxides / sulfides composites impregnated from nano-structured carbon materials with a specific capacitance of 2000 F/g. Syntheses of electrode materials are carried out through viable and cost-effective electrochemical approach and can be carried out at room temperature using water-based electrolytes.  Designing of this asymmetric hybrid capattery is based on both Faradaic as well as electrical double layer charge-transfer technique and hence this capattery is having high specific energy and specific power and can be viable alternate to secondary batteries. Electrolytes as well as dielectrics will be chosen to fine-tune the specific capacitance and potential window (specifically on discharging after galvanostatic charging).   Importantly, charging-discharging life cycle is more than 10,000 times with  90  retention. Entire fabrication process does not involve hazardous materials and methodologies and also does not require high-tech or costlier machineries. Hence, this fabrication process can be extended to real-time industrial scale manufacturing for commercial perspective.","The primary aim of this project is to design industrially viable and cost-effective fabrication of a hybrid capattery with high specific energy and capacitance as an electrical energy storage device via green technologies.1310Though supercapacitors are known for higher specific capacitance with specific power, still lacking in specific energy with reference to Lithium-based batteries. And Lithium-based batteries are having high specific energy but has lower specific power. 1310As of date, lithium-based batteries are lacking to meet the high-power requirements for real-time applications such as electric vehicles. 1310Moreover, batteries are having a lower number of cycles (3500 times), whereas this capattery will have a higher number of cycles ( 10000 times).1310So this proposal is to develop a hybrid capattery device which is a combination of high power density supercapacitor and high energy density battery with enhanced lifetime (higher number of charging-discharging cycles). 1310Most importantly, the fabrication of electrode material is relatively cheaper, viable and can be extended to industrial-scale production for real-time applications.1310Arduino Uno interfaced, proto-type hybrid supercapacitor will be designed and will be deployed for real-time applications as an energy storage device.","The primary objective is to fabricate low-cost as well as viable electrode materials and electrolytes to enhance the specific power as well as specific energy of the existing batteries and supercaps. 1310In the first phase of trial studies, we achieved a specific capacitance of about 2800 F/g. This will be fine-tuned with reference to the composition of the electrode material and electrolyte.1310Nanocarbon-derived mixed transition metal oxides (FeO, NiO, ZnO, CoO, RuO, MnO2) films will be fabricated at room temperature via galvanostatic method. Rare earth metal oxides such as Ceria will also be incorporated. 1310Similarly conducting polymers such as substituted PANI will be synthesized electrochemically and will be used as electrolytes. To achieve higher potential and power density, specific polymer electrolytes will be used. Nanocarbon materials such as MWCNT and rGO will be co-deposited to enhance the surface area and to retard the specific resistance.1310It must be emphasized that fabrication of both electrode materials, as well as electrolytes, are carried out by green approach and at room temperature only. 1310By fine-tuning the composition of the electrode materials and electrolytes, specific power, as well as energy and reversible cycles, can be enhanced.1310 9Mathematical modelling and numerical simulations will be carried out to optimize bath parameters, crystal structure data as well as specific capacitance and specific energy of the film in various electrolytes.","1.9Can be deployed in real-time applications as a cost-efficient electrical energy storage device such as smartphone batteries, automobile batteries etc.13102.9Can replace batteries, since capatteries are having desired energy density. As a result, the unit cost for energy storage will be reduced. 13103.9Can be deployed in applications that require high specific power such as electric vehicles, portable heavy machinery.13104.9Since capatteries are having relatively higher life-time (higher number of charging-discharging cycles) than batteries, net operating cost (expenditure for replacement) will be reduced. 13105.9They can be quickly recharged, unlike batteries. 13106.9Can be used to harvest solar energy.13107.9Dependency of fossil fuels will be reduced if deployed in automobiles and vehicles. 13108.9Can be deployed in Uninterrupted Power Supplies and medical instruments.1310","As of date, batteries are having more than 99 percent market share under electrical energy storage devices. 1310Still, supercapacitors are not effectively deployed for real-time applications such as in smartphones, vehicles as well as in uninterrupted power supply systems. 1310But batteries are lacking a lower lifetime and power density and they require relatively higher maintenance than capatteries. 1310If a capattery with high specific power is developed, then it has the highest market potential and can replace batteries. This proposal aims to fabricate such a capattery with higher specific energy as well as specific power. By fine-tuning electrode materials as well as electrolytes, it is possible to design a capattery with a higher specific capacitance that can replace batteries. 1310Currently, a proto-type model is fabricated with the assistance of Energe Capacitors Ltd, Rajapalayam 626117, Tamilnadu.",Dr. M Kanagasabapathy  Assistant Professor   Department of Chemistry  Rajapalayam Rajus College  Rajapalayam 626117  Tamil Nadu,41 years of experience in teaching and research with 24 paper publications,Email: rrcmksgmail.com              Mobile: +91 9443862183,"Multiwalled nano carbon tube / reduced Graphene oxide embedded ternary and quaternary mixed transition metal oxide / sulphide composites based electrodes were fabricated.

Although cleaning of solar panel has been a defining challenge for researchers mainly for balancing the cost with performance and durability, continuous efforts in this direction seem to be a positive step towards enhancing the efficiency of the devices. Dust is a fine, dry powder comprising miniature units of earth or waste material. Dust settlement for the most part depends on many no. of components such as size, weight, shape, site, tilt point surface completion, compound properties, stickiness, wind speed, etc. There are several challenges and benefits related to the cleaning techniques and involved labor cost and equipment . All the techniques are mainly focused on reducing the adhesion bond between dust particles and the panel by controlling electrostatic repulsion. The equipment needed is quite expensive in these methods and most of the techniques are installed separately on each solar panel. Therefore we need to design and develop a sustainable system that uses non-contact, continuous techniques which require little or no labor for cleaning.","Solar photovoltaic (SPV) plants are symbols of clean energy generation.

As its been acknowledged that 20 of the drivers have become indignant via means of riding the complete block to search for a vacant spot to park the car. In the present, a Real time parking guidance system is being developed with defined architecture using communication protocols and a software solution. ","Concerns around parking are becoming more pressing in order to better serve the city center. Recent advancements in meeting the globally linked spectrum could change these recurrent parking challenges into new opportunities. This Idea starts with detection of parking spaces that are free and occupied using Computer vision and numpy. The parking lot data is sent to a cloud server and reports the status of the parking lot through an online dashboard. The Software will take a coordinate file which will be generated from a snapshot of the image of the parking lot of video input. The system pipeline processing  is designed with the consideration of flexibility, online surveillance, data transmission, detecting accuracy and, and system reliability. This smart parking system allows people to save time, cut fuel consumption and reduce emission of carbon dioxide as well.","The main objective behind our project is to propose and spread awareness on how a parking lot space can be visualized . Today, due to the increase in the population which is directly proportional to the increase in the number of  vehicles, parking has become such a big issue. This system is very  advantageous as it reduces traffic, pollution, and results in minimal accidents. It is cost efficient and deduct management costs as well. It works as a user-friendly guide driver which helps a user not to wait too long at a parking lot. An 8220ECO-FRIENDLY8221 system as it saves fuel and decreases the emission of carbon dioxide. The real time smart car parking system can be implemented in 1310 Shopping malls, Restaurants, Theatres. Booking a parking space in an incentive parking lot.","The usage of vehicles is increasing exponentially day by day. This is resulting in the increasing traffic and the vehicle users are unable to find a parking space in these urban areas. The theme is to propose and spread awareness on how a parking lot space can be visualized. The process is complex and needs lots of focus , knowledge and money. With rising traffic congestion, demand for real time parking systems, which can assist municipal administrations in properly managing dispersed parking spaces and assisting drivers in finding available parking spaces, is likely to rise. The capacity of these systems to provide the required flexibility and scalability is likely to contribute to the expansion. The biggest limitation to the markets growth during the projection period is a lack of understanding about the benefits of smart parking. Market growth is likely to be aided by an increase in the use of integrated automated systems, as well as advancements in wireless and digital payment technologies. Machine-to-machine (M2M) connectivity, data analytics, enhanced sensors, smart parking meters, and mobile applications for slot bookings and online payments are among the technologies used to create these systems. These technologies are used to assess whether a parking lot is empty or occupied, as well as to evaluate and communicate data to mobile and web applications. The market is predicted to grow as a result of these technological advancements.","Prof. P. Srikanth, Dept. Of Mechanical Engineering   Dr. B.

The polling station is automated either it may be or at parament place or the same be put in a vehicle which is movable called mobile polling station. The polling station entry and exit is controlled by the automation process, where no manual intervention is required. The authenticity of voter is also done by using either Aadhar biometric or Aadhar IRIS input taken from the voter and processed, thus automated verification process is done without agent and polling officer presence. The principles shows that the entire process is automated at the level of polling station where voter exercise his/her vote without fear which leads to fair election process. In this process the voter id card is not required, which is a tedious process of inclusions and deletions regularly for every election. The extension of the above automated process, we need to connect the polling stations permanent and mobile both to the servers from where we are controlling the polling stations. The servers are at two layers, at first layer the constituency wise polling stations are connected to the local servers and at second layer all the local servers are connected to the central election commission server.

The main uniqueness of this dryer is the availability of provisions for controlling the process parameters. 1310The following are the uniqueness of the innovation of the proposal:13101. The vertical axis rotary drying chamber13102. Provisions for controlling the process parameters13103. Portable and compact13104. Reduced power consumption in comparison to conventional dryers13105. Fluidized bed drying chamber1310","The working fluid (air) is force to flow through the rotary drying chamber, hence the mode of mass transfer is observed to be convective mass transfer. As per the Newton8217s law of cooling analogy for convective mass transfer phenomenon the concentration difference is the driving force for the mass transfer, so the concentration difference in moisture between the dry air and herbal leaves will leads to transfer of water vapour from the herbal leaves to the dry air and the drying is achieved.  1310The herbal leaves are loaded into the rotary fluidized bed drying chamber which rotates about the vertical axis to impart centrifugal force to the leaves. The moisture content in the leaves is expelled towards the circumference of the drying chamber and gets dripped to the water collecting tank. 1310The herbal leaves after subjected to rotation is deposited at the bottom of the chamber and then it is dried by dry air which is heated by heat pump. During this secondary drying process drying chamber is periodically rotated in the opposite direction about its vertical axis for increasing the surface area of contact between the air and leaves. The secondary drying process is repeated till the desired percentage reduction in weight of leaves is achieved.1310","Drying of herbal leaves has become mandatory for farmers involved in cultivation of herbal leaves for adding value to the product. Siddha and Ayurveda industries required dryers for drying herbal leaves to facilitate powdering process and preserve it for long period of time. 1310The portable heat pump dryer is available in the market for drying the cloths alone. Hence a dryer customized for formers, Siddha and Ayurveda industries will benefit them immensely.  1310The main disadvantage in the contemporary heat pump dryers are as follows:13101.9Larger in size 13102.9Cost of the dryer is high13103.9Less portability13104.9No integrated drying chamber.1310The proposed herbal leaves dryer mitigates the above disadvantages of the contemporary heat pump dryer, so there is a bright opportunity for this heat pump dryer. 13109The farmers in and around the Virudhunagar district are facing many problems in drying and also the methods followed by them are highly consuming electricity. These specific problems were brought to us by the herbal leaves cultivators and Siddha medicine manufactures in Virudhunagar district.   During the brief discussion with them we understood that there is an high demand for this type of dryer in Tamilnadu and also all over in India. So the market opportunities are very large once the proposed model is successfully completed. 1310 Target Market131082269Small scale formers cultivating herbal leaves131082269Siddha industries 131082269Ayurveda medicinal industries","Our team decided to work on Herbal leaves drying after an interaction with farmers involved in herbal plants cultivation. Two farmers from Aruppukottai involved in cultivation of Moringa trees was introduced by the proprietor of Tamilnadu Council for Enterprise Development (TACED) and explained to us about the problems encountered by them in drying. After several trials with non- scientific methods the farmer encouraged us to find a solution to this problem as it will benefit the society a lot. Further, the farmers highlighted the loss of nutrients issue in contemporary drying methods and endorsed us to develop a dryer which minimise the nutrient losses. 13109A heat pump dryer was designed fabricated and experimental investigation was performed on five different types of herbal leaves like Tulsi, Bermuda grass, Curry leaves etc. In this proposal, it is planned to combine the heat pump dryer with a rotary drying chamber for drying.  The experience in working with heat pump dryer is helpful in design and developing the product for this proposal. An experimental investigation has to be performed on the product after the fabrication process to validate our drying process for preservation of nutrients. 13109The product will be of great use to farmers trying to add value to their product and to the siddha and Ayurveda medicine manufacturers.

The RF (Radio Frequency Analysers) and radar which will track the suspicious drones and it will take down the drones.1310Thermal Imaging:1310 Thermal camera captures and creates an image of an object using infrared radiation emanating from an object through a process called thermal imaging. The created image represents the temperature of the object. The basic technology of thermal photography is first designed for the military. Both infrared radiation and visible light are part of the electric spectrum, but unlike visible light, infrared radiation cannot be detected by human eyes directly. Which explains why a hot camera is unaffected by light and can give a clear picture of an object even in a dark place.1310Infrared power has a wavelength starting at about 700 nanometres and extending to about 1mm. Shorter waves than these begin to appear with the naked eye. Thermal cameras use this infrared energy to capture hot images. The camera lens focuses on infrared power in a set of detectors that then create a detailed pattern called a thermogram. ","Every day We are losing our Brave and honoured Army Troops and Soldiers.

221,IDEACH004758,Kashma,CHANDIGARH,CHANDIGARH,A cost effective and reusable hydrogel based superabsorbent for water filtration,NO,"The development of a hydrogel-based water filter itself will be a new invention. Various types of water filters have been manufactured for many years, however, their availability and accessibility to every household is still a problem of concern. Especially for the people living in rural areas, there is a lack of water filtration devices usually because of their high cost and set-up procedures. This obviously excludes the less privileged from basic amenities and moreover, the increase in urbanization is making the natural water bodies polluted and unfit for drinking purposes. Designing of low-cost hydrogel-based water filter will make it easily accessible to both rural as well as urban areas. The proposed project will definitely benefit society on large scale. The reusability, cost-effectiveness, high absorptivity, ability to remove chemical contaminants, and bacterial contaminants through silver nanoparticles of hydrogels make it an ideal material for the manufacturing of a filtering device. To date, no such device has been made using this method as cited in the literature above and this work will therefore stands as novel and highly efficient.","Objectives of the project:131082269To design a potential water filter from natural gum (Moringa Oleifera gum) based cost effective superabsorbent for water purification to meet the need of rural India.131082269To decorate the designed superabsorbent with silver nanoparticles for destroying the bacterial contaminants.131082269To characterize the synthesized hydrogel samples by using FTIR, H1 8211NMR, UV-Visible spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, TEM.131082269To validate the results through adsorption kinetics131082269To test the purity of water after filtration through different parameters like TDS, conductivity, alkalinity, pH, Acidity, Sulphates, chlorides, hardness.131082269To perform reusability studies of the developed filter131082269To study the biodegradation studies of used superabsorbent to check its degradation in burial soil and compost soil.131082269To perform cytotoxicity and MTT assay for proving its desirability for human consumption.131082269Final product testing as per Industrial standard.13101310","Water is the elixir of life and it is important for humanity not only for drinking but also for many other daily activities and therefore we can8217t sustain our life without it. Due to the rapid growth of the global population, modernization, and industrialization, the quality, and quantity of water have been depleted a lot. People in rural areas either lack adequate water purification facilities or are not economically stable enough to afford the currently developed water purifiers. The proposed device will be cheap and cost effective and thus can afford it in rural areas where people face a lot of problems with poor water quality. The product is portable, easy to use requiring no technical handling and electricity to operate and can be used in any zone of the country. Its rapid rate of degradation makes it non-harmful to the environment adding another point to its advantages. Its cost-effectiveness will make it an affordable filtration device to be used in rural areas or by the economically weak community. The rural area will be highly benefitted by using this device as it is affordable, cost-effective, reusable and reliable for the removal of contaminants.13101310","The current technology utilized for water purification, involves relatively expensive synthetic materials which are often non-sustainable for the poorest communities in society. It is conceivable that hydrogel based filter will be developed from inexpensive, abundant, and   sustainable resources (such as polysaccharides and low-cost material e.g., gums obtained from trees such as Moringa Oleifera gum) which can lower the cost, as hydrogels offer the ability to remove a wide range of pollutants in one step, via size exclusion and/or adsorption. It will be a portable device requiring no electricity for operation, no technique to be used making it easy for a layman to use it and can be used in any zone of the country. Coating the surface of hydrogel will silver nanoparticles provide additional benefits as they will disinfect the water from various microorganisms and pesticides. The hydrogel based technology not only will be suitable for tackling global drinking water challenges, but will also provide a new low-cost platform for various pressure-driven filtration techniques, such as microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis.

222,IDEATS004773,Banavathu venkata krishna prasad,TELANGANA,RANGA REDDY,VR Assisted Tele-Operated Robotic Ultrasound System,The following are the major novel features of our system that have the potential to patent and the same was confirmed by the patent attorney and we have even filed a provisional patent with patent number- 202241009944.,"We propose a safe and secure telerobotic ultrasound system that can be operated remotely by a radiologist thereby solving the need for the physical presence of a radiologist at the patient site. The solution consists of two parts one being the patient station which consists of a 7dof robotic configuration capable of executing all the motions necessary for performing ultrasound rocking, tilting, rotation and translation where our design offers a large workspace, therefore, offering capabilities to perform ultrasound on the lateral side as well. The motions performed by the doctor are exactly replicated through the robot in real-time. The ultrasound image is processed and transmitted to the radiologist8217s screen for diagnosis. Data being transmitted is encrypted to ensure maximum security. At the second part of our product, the doctor8217s station the radiologist sitting remotely performs the ultrasound on the patient. He controls the robotic arm using a paired control probe and joystick. Doctor gets the real-time position of the probe. There is audio-video communication from the patient for continuous feedback. Real-time ultrasound images are received and reported.","As per WHO, imaging is needed for diagnosis in 20-30 per cent of clinical cases and ultrasound and/or plain radiographs are sufficient for 80-90 per cent of those cases. Yet, two in three across the world lack access to medical imaging. Even in India 68.84 per cent of the population live in rural India and 80 per cent of the radiologists are in urban areas, this leads to a lack of access to medical imaging which makes people travel long distances for quality healthcare and miss an early diagnosis. Considering the challenges in delivery of quality healthcare services in remote areas our team is developing a Tele Operated Robotic Ultrasound System-TORUS, which can perform a safe and secure ultrasound even from remote locations ensuring diagnosis from a distance.13101310With our system, a radiologist has full control of all the movements of a probe on the patient8217s abdomen like rocking pitch, tilting roll, rotation and positioning ensuring he can perform the service from a remote location without any change in the quality of service. Pressure measurement, haptic feedback and the controller design ensure that the doctor does not need to change his habit of performing the ultrasound as well. The team has proved the principle with simulations and basic fabrication.","Potential areas of application:13101310- Patients with limited mobility or have the limitation to travel long distance and lacks emergency diagnostic care in towns with a population of fewer than 60,000.13101310- Considering the pandemic situations, the product could be used for substituting existing ultrasound scanning where there is prolonged direct contact between doctor and patient.13101310- Government PHCs which does not have essential screening and diagnostic facilities could use our mobile unit to improve the reach of ultrasound facilities to remotest areas of India.13101310- Ultrasound imaging places a crucial role in diagnosing a patient8217s state in emergency cases. But there is a lack of access to a full-time radiologist in emergency department. Our product could be used in such a situation where the physical presence of a radiologist is not necessary at the same time providing service full-time.13101310- Product could be used in offshore facilities, military camps, detention centres etc. where there is limited medical accessibility.","Total Available market TAM of US scan in India is about 8830 Cr.

The basic purpose is the identification of the shelf-life of the fruits by using non-destructive and non-penetrative methods, thus helping the farmers, fruit distributors or warehouse dealers in extending or prolonging the remaining useful life of fruits. A specially designed incubator with a triggered regulator can time the ripening process as per the requirement and is beneficial for decision making for agriculture value chain actors. The major advantage of the design is the hand-held device with easy-to-use features and fast results. It is a lightweight with a robust framework for running the inference on mobile, as it imparts the results within a fraction of a second and also results in good generalization ability. Our design can be easily replicated and  deployed over multiple devices and can help large group of workers to finish the task of grading in no time. The work process of the warehouses and fruit storage units gets automatized. It can give a clear picture to the managers about the condition of fruits at their dashboards, avoids a lot of manual and paper work, thus saving money.","What we found: Currently, the quality of the fruits has been assessed manually by visual inspection of their physical characteristics like color, size, and external damages which is not useful to find the internal damages of the fruits as well as not beneficial to determine precise shelf-life of fruits. So, the major concern in the present system is finding the internal damages/contamination of the fruits non-destructively for identifying fruits shelf-life accurately. So, the biggest challenge is the reduction of post-harvest loss: currently, the country is incurring the post-harvest loss of Rs2 lakh crore per year (in 2020-21 according to CAGR) is being the post-harvest losses at the time of harvesting (i.e. at the farm level), at the time of transportation as well as during the storage, which is varying from 15 to 50 percent every year. So, there is a need to equip with smart solution.    Solution: In the solution, a method is disclosed that finds internal damages without destruction of fruits as well as analyzing multiple significant maturity indices like color, ultra-structural changes in texture of the fruit to precisely measure the shelf life, optimum harvest time of the fruits.    Objective of the project: Development of version_1 of s/w + H/W prototype","1. This application would be helpful to reduce the post-harvest losses at the farm level, during the storage, during the transportation for all food supply chain stakeholders (Farmers, wholesalers, warehouses, exporters, Retailers)  2. Useful in sorting and grading of produces","There are no such systems available to predict the optimum harvest time as well as evaluate the quality and estimate the shelf-life precisely by observing the internal characteristics without cutting the fruits. So that produces can be dispatched at distant places according to their life and hence better price. So, our system delivers a solution for multiple problems like Segregation while taking the produce from a farm, reducing transportation and storage costs.    Impact: Environmental value: Preserving the environment due to reduction in post-harvest losses/wastes   Social value: Contributing to the Doubling Farm Income strategy due to reduction in post-harvest losses/wastes  Economic value: Improves product quality, increases export efficiency thus ultimately increasing farmers economy. Considering the current agricultural practices the proposed system has huge market potential.    Market: current focus is on addressing post harvest loss (PHL) in mango. Avg per kg cost of mango is Rs 116.39, and est revenue/ha is possibly Rs 3,84, 087/- (3.3 MT/hac). If we consider the Ratnagiri region of Maharashtra, revenue generation suppose to be Rs 2259.667 Cr. But, due to PHL (12.74 percent), total revenue could be decreased by Rs 286.147 Crores and at farm level (Rs 240cr). Initially if we cover at least 0.1 percent of market (i.e. 16 big farmers) at farm level, we could increase the revenue by Rs 2,40,42,700/.

This shows the Soybean Harvester market Potential. This is great opportunity to capture the market by giving efficient  function able harvester to the farmers. About 95 per cent farmers reported that shortage of the labor during the peak period of demand unavailability of labor during sowing, intercultural operations, spraying, harvesting and threshing as major constraint in soybean production. Same number of farmers (95) reported high labor charges at time of peak operations like sowing, weeding and harvesting. As the labor requirement during the sowing, intercultural operations and harvesting of soybean is generally high due to glut of harvesting kharif crops at a time, availability of enough labor at reasonable wages is the major monetary aspect of soybean cultivation which directly helps in the earning economic benefits to farmer.

The catalyst they developed for the process is a unique organo metallic complex to achieve better conversion, product selectivity and yield. Mild reaction conditions are also possible with this type of catalyst.","Bio bag manufacturing industries produce sizable volume of waste materials starting from Extrusion, printing and bag making process. These waste materials are classified as plain waste and printed waste. Accumulated PLA based waste materials are subjected to reprocessing. The reprocessing process involves grinding, melting and extruding to small particles suitable for mixing with virgin raw materials. In order to obtain desired physical properties of blown film, usage of reprocessed raw material (RP) is restricted to 0.5 to 1.0 wt/wt. Therefore it is not economical to reprocess all the PLA based waste materials to extrudate. Chemical recycling of PLA is an alternative to mechanical recycling and composting of postconsumer PLA, resulting in lower production costs and value-added products.1310Chemical recycling methods, including pyrolysis, hydrolysis, and acid-base depolymerization, have been demonstrated in the literature however, these processes are characterized by high temperatures (250°C). Milder operating conditions can be achieved by the catalyzed transesterification reaction of PLA to produce alkyl lactates, which are considered as green solvents because of their low toxicity and biodegradability. Alkyl lactates are considered as substitutes to oil-derived solvents with applications in polymer manufacturing, biochemicals, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals etc. ","Synthetic plastics are indispensable in our everyday life.  They are typically organic polymers of high molecular mass most commonly derived from petrochemicals. Usage of these non-degradable materials has increased many folds due to their broad functionality and low cost. Extensive usage and demand for these materials resulted in plastic pollution which is considered one of the world8217s largest environmental disasters. This led to the development of a novel class of plastics, referred to as bio-based plastics. Poly(lactic) acid (PLA) is the most frequently used member of this family. Due to the lack of a holistic recycling strategy, its large scale utilization can turn out to be an acute source of plastic pollution in the future.  Unlike other attempts of reprocessing, chemical recycling of PLA establishes an eco-friendly recycling concept aimed at the production of a valuable lactate ester through solvent assisted transesterification of PLA waste. The primary objective of this innovation optimize the degradation parameters of PLA based spent bio bags by methanolysis process catalyzed by metal complexes to produce a green solvent viz., methyl lactate which can be transformed back into PLA via lactide. 1310 The scope of this innovation  is not only limited to the selection of an appropriate system) but also extends to analyze the selectivity of the solvent towards the PLA fraction in a commingled stream of different PLA substrates on the yield of the lactate ester.","Rapid industrialization and increase in the application of methyl lactate in various end-use industries such as agriculture, cosmetics, and industrial application, etc. are the key factors that are boosting the growth of the methyl lactate market. Also, the growing demand for methyl lactate in is driving the growth of methyl lactate market. The rise in the usage of biobased and non-toxic methyl lactate by end-use industries is one of the latest trends that is fueling the growth of methyl lactate market. Therefore, the manufacturers in the methyl lactate market are more focused on high-quality product offering that will increase their customer base. The end users in the agricultural sector are using methyl lactate as a solvent in the agriculture field for enhanced crop protection. Therefore, the methyl lactate is creating opportunities for the pesticide manufacturers to offer innovative product offering an broaden their product portfolio in the continually evolving methyl lactate market. The application of methyl lactate in agrochemicals as a solvent is expected to grow in the coming years. Also, the rising demand for high-quality methyl lactate among end users is expected to drive the growth of the methyl lactate market globally.","The Asia Pacific region is expected to dominate the methyl lactate market followed by North America and Europe region. The methyl lactate market in the Asia Pacific is expected to witness higher growth rate as there is a massive presence of methyl lactate manufacturers in China and Japan.The Asia Pacific region is expected to grow significantly in the methyl lactate market due to the increasing demand for methyl lactate in agriculture and pharmaceutical sector. North America region is expected to grow rapidly as there is an increased application of methyl lactate in various end-use industries. Europe, Latin America, and the MEA region are projected to contribute a significant share of the global methyl lactate market over the years to come.1310Highlights1310?9Adopted approach serves as a heuristic for prospective 8220circular economy8221 efforts.1310?9Use of mild reaction conditions and highly selective organic catalyst.1310?9Robust process capable of handling different post-consumer PLA substrates.1310?9Use of a sustainable solvent selective towards PLA fraction of a mixed stream.Alternate route for ethyl lactate production thus, conserving biogenic feedstock.","1.

229,IDEARJ004915,Maitree Bharat Dedhia,MAHARASHTRA,MUMBAI SUBURBAN,"Portable scanning device for non-destructive, early, instant and high precision detection of stem borers in grapes.",NA,"All the current solutions available in the market are either priced high or low impact or are both. The existing products and adaptations include using tools like screwdrivers which farmers use to tear open the bark of the stem of the grape tree, spraying chemicals like kerosene and dichlorvos which are harmful for both plants and humans. Farmers also install traps at different locations to prevent infestation in their farms, however, they are ineffective and end up capturing beneficial insects as well. Moreover, all these solutions focus on the stage when the stem borer has already started infestation to the extent that the farmers are able to see visual cues indicating almost 60 percent of infestation in the tree.1310We propose to detect infection inside the tree before visual and physical cues are notable to human naked eyes. This would also eliminate the error of visual cues going unnoticed by human tracers. Therefore, our solution on the other hand uses a non-invasive and a non-destructive method of detection of stem borers inside the tree.","Stem borers are xylophagous insects that infect crops resulting in reduction of tree life, impacting quality and yield of the produce. They affect many crops however impact is more in cash crops which are commercially very important to farmers, hence we focused on grapes. Current adaptations are primitive, insufficient and end up causing further damage to the tree. These solutions are practiced when the borer has already caused damage to the farm. Therefore, late identification is the main issue which compounds the current problems.1310To bridge these gaps, we plan to help farmers with an end to end solution. We aim to build a high precision, portable, non-invasive scanning device that can be used to find the extent of damage caused due to infestation and the exact spot of the stem borer inside the plant before identification of any visual or physical cues by human experts. This will help farmers by making the process of detection non-speculative. The system comprises a human-machine interface using which the farmer would be able to visualise the infestation and location of borers. Our innovation lies in the unique identification of the problem, digital signal processing of the radar signal and leveraging machine learning for high precision detection of stem borers in field conditions and for noise reduction. We have built a preliminary prototype for data collection.","Apart from grape stem borer the problem is prevalent in almost all crops like coffee with 40 percent yield loss, mango with 40-50 percent yield loss, sugarcane with 33 percent yield loss, and many more. The solution we are developing can be used to detect not just stem borers, but also other pests like fruit borers. This solution can also be used in other industries as well like detecting termites inside construction sites and walls.

232,IDEAKR004931,Vivek Ghate,KARNATAKA,DAKSHINA KANNADA,Localized Delivery of Cyclosporine-A to Cause Thickening o the Peri-Implant Mucosa during the Placement of Dental Implants,"The proposed idea aims to favorable utilization of the drawback of cyclosporine A in terms of causing gingival hyperplasia to increase the success of dental implants. The technology of developing a double layered patch with one sided drug release, is unique in the terms of application around the implant, protection of drug from washing off into the saliva, and exertion of the local action. Moreover, the formulation reduces the overall dose of drug required to induce advantageous gingival hyperplasia. Though patches are attempted in the past of the treatment of dental and oral cavity disorders, no reports exist on the proposed technology for the augmentation of the peri-implant mucosa. The success of the project may result in a significant solution towards the conventional techniques such as grafting, and surgery for increasing the thickness of the peri-implant mucosa. In line with it, a draft of the work is submitted to the patent agent for a detailed prior art search and filing of the provisional patent. ","The novelty of the proposed product lies in the following areas:1310(1) The selection of the active agent: Cyclosporine-A is a commonly prescribed corticosteroid, which has a major side-effect of causing gingival hyperplasia. The effect is more pronounced during oral and systemic dosing.  The proposed solution utilizes the side-effect of the well-known drug as a way to solve the problem of dental implant rejection. 1310(2) Unmet need in dental healthcare: Dental implants are being used extensively to effectively treat the dental complications, and the success of the procedures remain at the expense of the proper thickness of the peri-implant mucosa. The reduction in the dose due to the bioadhesive nature of the product will overcome the potential risks of systemic dosing of cyclosporine-A. 1310(3) The unique and novel approach: The proposed solution of mucoadhesive patches as a platform for the delivery of cyclosporine-A enables a localized delivery of the drug to the peri-implant tissues, reduces the wastage of the drug via saliva, and thereby reducing its side-effects. 1310(4) Continence and self-application: The patch formulation enables the easy application onto the gingival tissues of the implant laden tooth socket, and can be administered without the help of a visit to the clinical setup. 1310","82269The current treatments for achieving peri-implant mucosal augmentation is surgery and grafting. These procedures are invasive and extremely skill-intensive processes and effect the patient and their quality of life. 131082269Our solution is the non-invasive and non-surgical use of cyclosporine-A in the form of a double layered dissolving mucoadhesive patch system. 131082269Cyclosporine-A is in clinical practice as an immunosuppresant. However, gingival hyperplasia has been reported as a major side-effect during long-term therapy with cyclosporine-A. 131082269Our invention uses thus aims at repurposing cyclosporine-A to use its inherent property of gingival hyperplasia, to cause peri-implant mucosal augmentation for effective placing of a dental implant. 131082269Furthermore, the phenytoin as an active agent is housed in a double layered dissolving mucoadhesive patch thereby reducing its systemic exposure, and action at the site-of-complication. 1310 1310The objectives of the study are - 1310(1) Formulation and characterization of the oral mucoadhesive patches containing cyclosporine-A 1310(2) Performance evaluation of the mucoadhesive patches, safety and toxicity evaluation 1310(3) Efficacy testing of the optimized formulation by comparing the thickness of the peri-implant mucosa before and after treatment in preclinical animals1310","The proposed solution falls under the category of dental healthcare and pharmaceutical interventions. The primary application of the product is in dental clinics and patients who have undergone placement of a dental implant, and those who have a thin peri-implant mucosa biotype. ","Dental implants to replace the missing teeth are gaining popularity all over the world. Long term success of the implant is strongly determined by the per-implant soft tissues integrity. Soft tissue thickness and contours are important diagnostic factors that influence the esthetic outcome of an implant restoration and also thin biotype may cause recession and bone loss around the implant which may lead to phonetic difficulties and food impaction. All these will lead to implant failure, and huge financial loss as well as mental and physical trauma to the patient. Thus the market potential for the product is large especially in India owing to the number of dental implants being used in the dental setup, and the affordability of the implant. "," Dr. Veena K.

238,IDEAKR004988,Samarth Magod,KARNATAKA,BENGALURU (URBAN),Solar Powered Thermoelectric Refrigerator,No existing intellectual property,"Portable refrigerators are sometimes very necessary, especially in a place far from home or for transportation of goods, blood, and vaccines. For these purposes, thermoelectric cooling machines can be an option because thermoelectric cooling machines are more compact, with no leakage problems, lighter, portable, easier to maintain, and more durable. These days society faces an energy crisis but also the harmful effects of pollution. Thermoelectricity is a 8220Green Technology8221 to generate electricity without any harmful effect. The educational institutions, furnace regions, metro cities, industrial areas, universities, and other locations can be selected for the establishment of such energy centers where the waste heat can be easily available and can be recycled after conversion to the same system. This system would be used for air ventilation in cars. This system is a boost for government policies like solar cities and solar cities as well. ","The performance of solar TE (Thermo Element) cooling systems can be enhanced by improving and optimizing the heat exchanger structure and the operating parameters because those aspects significantly affect the efficiency of the whole system.1310Moreover, the performance of a solar TE cooling system can be improved by selecting TE and PV (Photo Voltaic) systems with higher performances. The average ZT (Zero Tolerance) value of the TE module is only approximately 0.8 at present. If the ZT factor of the TE material could be further improved and increased to, for eg 2.0 the COP (Coefficient of Performance) value and energy saving of this TE cooling system would be further increased. The advances in TE material make it possible to significantly improve the ZT factor through nanotechnology. Two primary approaches are bulk samples containing nanoscale constitutes and low dimensional materials. New TE materials with larger ZT factor values intrigue breakthroughs in various applications.The main objective of this study is to design and build an affordable solar thermoelectric refrigerator for the people living in remote parts of our country where electricity is still not available."," The refrigerator could be used to store perishable items and facilitate the transportation of medications as well as a biological material that must be stored at low temperatures to maintain effectiveness. The design of the solar-powered refrigerator is based on the principles of a thermoelectric module (i.e., Peltier effect) to create a hot side and a cold side. The cold side of the thermoelectric module is utilized for refrigeration purposes to provide cooling to the refrigerator space. On the other hand, the heat from the hot side of the module is rejected to ambient surroundings by using heat sinks and fans. The designed solar thermoelectric refrigerator was experimentally tested for cooling purposes. The results indicated that the temperature of the refrigeration was reduced from 27 °C to 5 °C in approximately 44 min. The coefficient of performance of the refrigerator (COPR) was calculated and found to be about 0.16.1310i) Used in the Food industry1310ii) large kitchens to store food in the rural side.1310iii) Refrigerators are used where there is shortage of power, especially in automobiles and aircrafts.1310","Market to be focused on the remote areas and rural areas of the country. Whereas electricity supply is to less compared to urban and metropolitan areas. By selling it at a reasonable price where people can afford it, at the same time there should be a profit to the company. Most commercially available TE modules have a thermoelement length range from 1.0 · 10-3 m to 2.5 · 10-3 m. The new methodology to design the high-performance TE (Thermo Electric)cooling systems includes the following 2 main steps: use of the performance curve and the basic physical properties of a TE module measured from an accurate module test and use of nondimensional entropy flow equations to determine the TE cooling design parameters for the maximum COP of the TE cooling system. The investigations also showed that reducing the contact resistances is an essential requirement to achieve a further improvement in both COP and cooling capacity of a TE module. 1310These refrigerators can be power and cost savings in the food processing industries and even for the cryogenic industries. Even these refrigerators can be replaced by todays CFC, R134A, R-290 refrigerators used in households which cause damage to ozone layers during the manufacturing of CFC. Hence the idea can save the environment and also become the refrigerator can run without any power saving power to almost 20 percent(i.e 75 KWh/month per house) of total power consumption annually.1310","Dr. Pavan Tejasvi  Asst.

This invention is a smart way to save fuel and optimize power generation.,"Whenever the demand increases the CT coil experiences more current and provides a higher analog signal to the IC, which leads to activate the servo actuators. Servo actuator is connected to the Gear control lever as well as engine throttle proportionally and pulls it. By pulling the throttle the engine RPM increases and simultaneously by pulling the gear lever, the gear ratio decreases proportionally. The combination of these two mechanisms results in unchanged RPM as output for the alternate with enhanced torque which is now needed in load condition. 1310When there is some drop in load, the CT coil induces lower voltage for the IC. After processing the input data IC gives the signal to the stepper motor this proportionally actuates (Releases). The moment of the actuator changes the gear ratio of CVT and releases the throttle valve simultaneously which results, lower RPM of the engine and magnification in the gear ratio simultaneously. The combination results again unchanged speed as output for alternator but with lower torque as there is no load. In this condition the engine runs at its idling speed and consumes minimum fuel. Other conditions may occur in between condition 1 and 2 and the combination of Throttle, CV Gear ratio and EM Synchronizer provides unchanged RPM for alternator with exactly required torque for 50 Hz and 220 V without any noticeable fluctuation.

243,IDEAKL005042,Rosemary Benny,KERALA,THRISSUR,Namaste - The NoWaste App,No,"At the Black Soldier Fly factory, the collected food waste is fed to the BSF larvae. These larvae decompose all the biowaste to grow. Afterwards, the BSF larvae, the frass ( BSF larvae excreta) as well as the decomposed material is collected. Each of these products is very useful for people and will have a very high demand in the market. Also, Results show that direct CO2eq emissions are 47 times lesser than the emissions from composting. Regarding the overall GWP, the LCA shows that composting has double the GWP of the BSF treatment facility based on the functional unit of 1 ton of biowaste (wet weight). The BSF larvae are an extremely high source of protein since they convert around 90 of the food waste into proteins in their body. The larvae known to be extremely rich in protein can be successfully used as a substitute for animal feed at prices as low as half of the cost of currently available animal feed. The decomposed organic matter and frass can be used as manure for plants and crops. These larvae can be fed to pets such as reptiles and birds. The availability of these larvae and other products at any given time is not an issue since a single female fly can produce up to 500 eggs. Mass production can thus be achieved at very low costs. The collection and breeding of these flies can be achieved with as little effort as some light and a cage and the black soldier flies do not eat when fully grown. ","We solve the problem of the disposal of solid waste through our app and factory.1310The aim is to start a community for proper collection and relaying of waste from individual households through our app, and managing and disposing of them via methods beneficial to the environment and the society as a whole. We use a sustainable farming system to grow, hatch and raise black soldier fly larvae for pets like reptiles, chickens and small animals. We market our larvae products under the brand name Namaste. The cost of animal feed could be reduced to 50  by using BSF Treatment.1310Currently, fish feed costs ?60 per kg, but usage of BSF larvae as feed could reduce the cost to ?15 per kg, and even if we sell it at a cost of ?30 per kg it is profitable for both farmers and us.1310The quantity of feed needed would also drastically reduce since 5g of BSFL would compensate for 10g of the ordinary food feed.1310","Our app Namaste, about what it does and how the app works to provide a convenient platform for people to not only get rid of the household waste but also dispose of it in the most effective and eco-friendly way possible.

The volunteers have frequent collection trips throughout the week, the timings of which are decided beforehand and stored in the app to provide the users with a choice. The user can then select a date and time from the list to schedule their pickup. Apart from this option, the app also shows the nearby waste collection centres to the user in case the person wants to personally drop the waste off at a centre. One of our aims, a subtle one for that, is to empower women and women communities. We intend to include women organizations in the collection and transit process of the waste, thus empowering them.","The initial investment required for this solution is negligible.

Flower waste needs pretreatments like drying, followed by mechanical pretreatment of crushing the flowers. Flower waste is slightly acidic in nature. It should be treated with alkaline chemicals like sodium carbonate (washing soda) solution to enhance its biodigestibility. A fixed dome or a floating drum type bio-digester will be used to carry out anaerobic digestion of flower waste, which produces raw biogas containing around 55-60 percent of combustible methane gas. The raw biogas with less methane percentage can be useful for cooking purpose or at the place of its generation. To make biogas as a high energy fuel, removal of contaminants like carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and moisture should be removed from raw biogas.

Though other systems have fingerprint sensor, our product unlocks through fingerprint sensor  of authorized person.only at particular latitude and longitude location. If the authorized person  is not available, an OTP is sent to the authorized mobile so that the tanker gets unlocked. The  locator continuously tracks the tanker. The location data will be compared with the real time  traffic of that particular location. If the traffic is too high and the tanker is moving slowly,  then there will be no problem. If there is no traffic in the location and the tanker is either  moving slowly or halts for a longer period of time, then an alert message will be sent to the  owner using GSM module. The real time location data and the live stream can be accessed  using the APP. In case of any problem, the retailer will be able to monitor through the app   which is interfaced with Raspberry Pi Camera","Pilferage of fuel has been a big concern for oil companies. Often tanker drivers would stop on   highways to steal fuel. There have been instances of adulteration, where these drivers would take  out several liters of the fuel and replace it with some other liquid of similar density. The safety of  the vehicle is also important as the fuel should be transported safely without any accidents from  the terminal to gas station.The main intention is to deliver every drop to the retailer as every drop  is countable and it is important. Actually the problem is when a petroleum tanker starts its  journey from source to destination. In the middle of the journey adulteration and pilferage is  done. As this is the major problem which we are facing, so our method is to solve the problem by  arranging a smart lock system at the opening of the tanker. After reaching the destination the  valve is opened only if the finger print of the authorized retailer is matched. With the help of the  GPS tracker at a particular latitude and longitude location the finger print gets accessed only by    the authorized person and the servo motor rotates and the lock opens. An SMS is sent to the  owner if anyone tries to steal the vehicle.

The current concept is to safeguard construction employees from any damages and injuries while on the job. A Miners HELMET with different sensors, including an ultrasonic sensor, a GPS tracker, and a heartbeat sensor, as well as a carrier to communicate with co-workers and a solar backup unit that can light up the torch on the Miners Helmet, are all included in the suggested design. The existing one lacks a heart rate sensor and a torch with solar backup, both of which are critical for worker safety.","Working on the site as a miner or a construction worker is incredibly dangerous. Workers end up falling over a cliff and being crushed by stones, as well as being dumped into trenches excavated by others. This invention is proposed in order to avoid these unplanned disasters. A hard Miners Hat with sensors which includes a temperature sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and heartbeat sensor to prevent such events. All of these sensors are linked together via an Arduino microcontroller, allowing them to interact. To power the sensors, solar-batteries or easily accessible rechargeable batteries are used. A temperature sensor determines if the temperature around the worker is dangerous, while an ultrasonic sensor informs the worker when an object approaches. A heartbeat sensor monitors a workers physical condition and informs co-workers while also providing information about the person in risk. Even if the injured worker is located, the location is imprecise, thus the model incorporates a GPS tracker in the Miners Hat that may be used to identify the injured workers location so that a co-worker can assist him. In the mining and construction industries, this invention assures worker safety and security.","The mining industry is important to the economy. Because India is a developing country, citizens are required to work on a daily basis in order to earn a living this includes jobs such as miner and construction workers. Working as a miner or a construction worker on the site is extremely hazardous. Employees end up falling from a cliff and being crushed by stones, as well as entering into dug trenches. This idea plays a key role in preventing all of these mishaps before occurring in mining and construction sites. The proposed solution is to protect employees from risks and assist them in resolving difficulties. Its done by integrating various sensors to alert the worker to potential dangers such as heatstroke, dizziness, and suffocation. To monitor these characteristics, temperature sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and heartbeat sensors are all housed in one piece on that Miners Hat.","Mines are regarded as high-risk environments in India. Because of the danger to their lives, many people are unwilling to work there. By providing workers with the necessary safety equipment and assuring their safety, many more people may be interested in working in mines because the chance of death is reduced. They are the most important components of the MADE IN INDIA programme. Mining businesses will gain from embracing our proposal since they will be able to give the highest quality safety equipment for their employees. Manpower grows as the percentage of mine employees who are safe increases. The export of minerals from mines can be enhanced by increasing labour.
