3	4.0	IDEATS002769	CH subba lakshmi	TELANGANA	RANGA REDDY	Design and Development of Smart and Sustainable Onboard charger for Electric Vehicle	No	The proposed Smart and Sustainable Onboard battery charger overcome the disadvantages of the existing EV battery chargers like dependency on Grid power, location of the charging stations, use of AC power supply alone, more energy conversion losses, high tariff rates / charging cost, etc. This smart EV charger consists of an exclusive MPPT based DC-DC converter to integrate solar energy and a conventional converter to integrate AC power supply. The addition of a DC-DC converter will have the following advantages over the conventional charger:    Integration of renewable and conventional AC grid for On-board charging of EV    Works for both AC and DC power supplies    Charging can be done anywhere at any time during the availability of solar energy    Independency from electricity bills and availability of charging stations.    Reduction in power consumption for vehicles air-conditioning due to solar panel embedment on the cars rooftop    Hassle-free integration of the backup battery    Environmentally friendly by the reduction of dependency on conventional power    ON Board DC-DC Converter functions can be extended to power up the Electric vehicle accessories.    Power losses will be reduced   This smart charger always prefers solar energy against conventional energy    The risk of vandalism and added clutter in an urban environment can be avoided    Reduction in EV charging infrastructure    Increased power grid stability	To meet the present increasing EV charging demands, it is proposed to have a smart and sustainable On board EV charger that make use of renewable energies to charge EV batteries with the following objectives:   1) Integration of solar energy for On-board charging   2) Increasing the efficiency of the charging cycle   3) Reduce the carbon footprint by using renewable energy for charging   4) Making the EV charging sustainable and reliable   5) Reduce the burden on centralized EV charging infrastructure.  The proposed EV charger consists of the latest art of technology and a fully digital MPPT based DC-DC converter that can facilitate charging the EV battery bank from a solar system embedded on a cars rooftop or residential rooftop or solar power parking stations. This will enable charging of EV battery bank from anywhere any time including travel time that makes usages of solar power effectively during its availability. The use of single-stage energy conversion i.e., DC-DC Conversion, reduces power losses and improves the efficiency of the system. Solar PV panels embedded on electric vehicles rooftops reduce the dependency on conventional power and also reduce carbon footprints for sustainable development. This charger gives priority to the energy coming from the solar system and the rest of the energy is drawn from the grid that will reduce the energy consumption from the conventional power grid. This improves grid stability and security.	The major area of application of the proposed system is Electric Vehicle Battery charging which has huge potential in the current and future scenario due to the intrusion of electric vehicles in the transportation sector.   This can also be used for the following applications:    Solar based LED lighting.    Drone battery charging.    Energy storage systems.    DC powered residential complexes    DC power Appliances    Charging of the Autonomous vehicles or rowers used for a variety of applications like space, farming and security systems, etc.   The proposed smart charger with minimal modifications in programming without changing the hardware can also be used to meet a large variety of market needs that uses DC-DC conversion.	The transition to electric mobility is a promising global strategy for decarbonizing the transport sector. India is among a handful of countries that support the global EV3030 campaign, which targets to have at least 30 new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. The central government of India launched the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME). Under phase II of FAME, the government will be largely focussing on the deployment of electric buses on the Indian roads. This move comes from the response received by the centre during the first phase FAME. The government-backed Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) has issued tenders for 20K EVs to be deployed across the country for government use. With this, the government aims an EV sales penetration of 30 for private cars, 70 for commercial cars, 40 for buses, and 80 for two- and three-wheelers by 2030. Under the Paris Agreement, India has committed to cutting its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity by 33 to 35 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, and to achieve 40 percent of its electricity generation from non-fossil sources by the same year. Since the proposed smart EV chargers are the most important component of the all-electric vehicles it is envisaged to have large market potential to meet current and future market demands as per above said govt policies.

4	5.0	IDEATS002773	TATA JOGI VENKATA VISWANATH	TELANGANA	MEDCHAL MALKAJGIRI	Consumer Appliance - A smart automatic breakfast (idli) maker	Yes, the idea is patented in the name of the applicant.	The innovation relates to a kitchenette electrical appliance - a fault tolerant and self-cleaning smart appliance for preparing batter by using pre-loaded raw materials. This mostly relates to South Indian breakfast Idli and Dosa which heavily rely on batter. The process of making batter is tedious, time taking and non-consistent with slightest variation in the dal types.	The primary objective of the present invention is to automate the breakfast process by developing an electrical appliance which performs several tasks such as grinding the dal, fermenting, mixing rice/ravva, preparing batter,  dispensing the batter to plates and cooking the required breakfast without any manual intervention. In addition to making batter, and cooking, the appliance is also runs self-cleaning, self-diagnosis and is a fault tolerant device.	This appliance is targeted to be a consumer appliance to be used at home and serves a fresh home cooked idli and variants without any manual involvement. This can serve a family of 5 and also given the simple to use nature, it can be used by people who do not how to cook. 	Idli is globally known as Rice cakes. This is cooked widely by the south east Asians and is a daily food for most of the South Indians. Hence the market potential is huge and goes beyond the current wet grinder market.	Mr. V.
