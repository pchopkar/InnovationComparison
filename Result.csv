"The manual process needs more man power and it consumes more amount of time .our new innovative machine can easily remove the midrib from the coconut leaf. By the usage of this machine, the speed of the removal process is 10 times more than the manual process. This method will help the farmers to reduce their work and also ease the risks.1310",82269To develop coconut midrib extraction machine for the coconut farmers131082269To develop cost effective machine to reduce the time consumption and manual process. 1310,The proposed machine will be used for the peoples engaged in the coconut farming. The proposed machine will improve the livelihood of those workers in the rural areas.,"Agriculture, Rivers & Ocean Produce based industries, fertilizers, Agricultural Implements & Agro processing and any related sub-sector",Approved,False
"For those with neuromuscular or spinal cord injuries that results in upper extremity impairments ,the most basic tasks like picking any items  , drinking or eating with a spoon can be nearly impossible . among such patients , the ability to reach accurately and  manipulate object is consistently rated as one of their most important challenges.1310Assistive Robotics can fill the gap. we are proposing the uniqueness of mounting humanoid robotic arm with Wheel chair to provide an increased sense of independence for users and this reduce the need for caretaker . However these devices are still very costly , making them virtually inaccessible to most of the people who need them . this is largely due to the expensive parts needed to enable the arm to adapt to the user and the environment in real time. The ability of robotic arms to benefit people today is largely limited due to high cost and excessive power consumption. 1310Now we are exploring the implementation of adaptive controls of hardware in an effort to address the need for a collaborative , user friendly , accurate robotic arm at a significantly reduced cost.1310","We believe that the development of a robotic arm based on neuromorphic (who is having spinal problem ) can be a game changer for people with disability ,it could make it easier for them to engage with community , boost their independence, and grant them employment opportunities . the expected cost and performance improvements are potentially disruptive to this market.13109The goal of this product is to produce assistive humanoid robotic arm for patients with wheel chairs. To do their basic tasks like picking ,dinking water , controlling the Home appliances , finishing the home works , controlling their own wheel chair etc..,1310",1)Hospitals 2) Airport 3) House Hold users 4) Old Age Homes,"Healthcare & Life sciences, Medical Devices, Pharmaceuticals, Biotech, AYUSH and any related sub-sector",Approved,False
