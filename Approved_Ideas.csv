In fact, cleaning is one of the post-harvesting key activities of certain agro products growing under the soil like potatoes, ginger, carrot, turmeric etc. Particularly small and marginal farmers are unable to clean properly prior to market their products. In consequence to this they are getting less profits for their products.In such context, the proximity of agro-product cleaners will give scope to encourage farmers for producing more products and marketing the total yield. At present certain agro-products cleaners were developed, but they are not available at affordable prices to small and marginal farmers. Not only this, non-availability of electrical power is also one of the causes for not using agro-product cleaners. In this context low cost manual tuber vegetable product cleaning machine has been developed. The proposed model is suitable in areas where there is a lack of proper electrification. The operation of this machine does not require electric powerand it works with the use of human muscle effort only.The proposed model is available at lower cost and it helps to avoid the squander of agro-products.  It is possible to empower small and marginal farmers through marketing their cleaned products for achieving greater value realization.","Principle and working of the proposed machine  The proposed Low cost manual tuber vegetable product cleaning machineworks on the principle of forced vortex flow. Centrifugal force caused by the continuous rotation of the cylinder leads to the separation of mud and dirt from the agro-products like potatoes, carrots, turmeric, etc.   (b) Description     The cleaning machine consists of two concentric cylindrical drums as shown in figure 1. The outer drum is made of plastic and the inner drum is the perforated/Mesh framed aluminum cylinder. The outer drum is fixed whereas the inner drum is rotated by means of hand operated lever (rotating hand lever).     More than half of the outer drum is filled with water and certain portion seeps in to the inner mesh framed drum. The agro products of (5-10 kg) to be cleaned are placed in the inner drum.  The operator rotates the inner drum with the help of hand operated lever. In order to increase the rotational speed of the drum a gear box maybe attached. The extent of cleaning can be visible to the operator from time to time as it has perforations/mesh.  The continuous motion of the drum causes the separation of mud and dirt from the products and the grey water can be drained through the drain hole provided on the outer drum and is collected in a tank.  The cleaned agro products are allowed to enter the dryer for drying operation.",The proposed model has the capability to be accepted by small and marginal farmers due to its low cost and easy operation without any electric power. This has a market in rural areas especially for small and marginal farmers who have a paucity in the availability of electricity and water at their expense. ,As per the interaction with farmers the Agro product that is cleaned is fetching more profit in the local market than the uncleaned one. This product can be utilized by small and medium farmers to reap the benefits from this model by value addition to their product.

Each extruder can print with a different filament material. It is useful for building soluble support structures and producing multicolored objects.,Each extruder can print with a different filament material. Having two extruders is useful for producing objects with multiple filaments and multiple colors. A project will require two colors to create a pattern in the design of a 3D printed object.,"At the moment, dual extruders are a simple upgrade to single extrusion. With dual extrusion, two nozzles share the same head and move as one piece. For this reason, 3D printers with dual extruders do not print twice as fast as printers with single extrusion. In order for that to be true, each nozzle would have to move independently without interfering with the other. Once you imagine that logistical nightmare, you understand why dual extrusion is still limited.","The main advantage of buying a dual extruder 3d printer is that you can print in multiple materials. Using multiple 3d printer filament materials is very useful for:13101310To understand the advantages of solid infill one must understand that with a single extruder model and supports are printed using the same material.

The external is placed along the battery cells, heat is transferred from the batteries to the Ethylene glycol and water mixture coolant. with the increased temperature the ethylene glycol and water get separated where water selectively evaporates through the membrane (permeate) and is condensed via a condenser placed. The coolant circulation is made possible by a suction pump at the permeate side. During null power condition the battery temperature is balanced due to the evaporation of the water available over the retenate. The condensed permeate reaches the Retenate and the cycle is continued. The proposed solution qualitatively provides cooling at uncertain conditions even when the system lacks power supply. This is made possible by the contribution of potential difference due to the heat generated in the batteries (retenate) and the permeate connected to the ambient temperature. This helps in larger mileage with higher battery life by reducing the power consumption by 75  consuming 25 of the power for coolant circulation.

","The aggressiveness of cavitating flow is mainly related to the kinetic energy, which is transferred to potential energy of the cavitation structure and further on to the energy (amplitude) of the pressure wave at the cavitation structure collapse. Following this reasoning, the highest possible flow velocity and pressure were used. In this regard it is designed to use two facing rotors with special radial grooves, where each one is spinning in the opposite direction. In this design, the rotors (90 mm diameter) are going to be driven by electric motors with power of 0.37 kW each has special geometry, which causes periodically repeating pressure drops is generated. The rotating frequency of the rotors is approximately 2800 rpm are used, which is giving a local velocity of up to 26 m/s.13101310Bacteria 8211Removal Mechanism1310Pathogenic bacteria can cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis and are a major cause of human death. They can also contribute to other globally important diseases, such as pneumonia. The effects of cavitation, initiated by ultrasound, on bacteria are well known (Stanley, 2004). Hydrodynamic cavitation as a possible tool for bacteria eradication due to high local temperatures of 5000 K (Arrojo et al., 2008). 13101310Thus the main objectives are:13101.9Development of novel hydrodynamic cavitation water treatment facility13102.9Development of Urban Small Water Enterprises","Water has been the essential component for economic as well as social development and for the soundness of cultures and civilization (Eftihia Tzen, 2012). Among the top 10 global challenges for the new millennium, pure drinking water attributes a lot of significance (Menachem, 2012 Richard, Nobel Laureate, 1996). Water scarcity is a global and a regional challenge and water consumption rate is doubling every 20 years because of exponential and unplanned growth of the population, is posing a key challenge (Elimelech, 2012 Kalogirou, 2005 WHO Reports, 2015). The availability of good quality water is on constant decline and the demand for the same is on the rise. Water shortages and unreliable water quality are considered major obstacles to achieve sustainable development and improvement in the quality of life (Lattemann, and Höpner, 2007). According to the United Nations, over 1.1 billion people lack safe drinking water (Lattemann, and Höpner, 2007 WHO Reports, 2015). In India, about 97 million people are without access to safe drinking water and 40 million people are affected by water borne diseases such as, fluorosis (fluoride contamination), arsenic (dangerous contaminant), diarrhea, cholera, hepatitis (bacteriological contamination) every year (WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program 2012). The Medical expenditure on water borne diseases is estimated to be Rs. 2, 400 crores annually in the country (BARC, India, 2010).","To understand the slums in better way, we have selected five slums and we have conducted ground studies by taking 100 households in each slum.

One of the most important and basic human needs in any country is a good waste management system and when a country is equipped with one, automatically many diseases are prevented from spreading. Waste can take any form, whether it is solid, liquid or gas, and each has different disposal and management methods. Waste management is intended to reduce the adverse health, environmental or aesthetic effects of the waste. Solid waste is defined as non-soluble materials ranging from municipal waste to industrial waste which contains complex and sometimes hazardous substances.13101310In this idea, it is designed and integration of novel eco-friendly solid waste management system with waste heat recovery, which turns any solid waste material permitted to be incinerated into pure ash within minutes and adhering to relevant emission standards. During the process, the temperature inside the closed chamber reaches very high degrees based upon the nature. We are designed to make use of this energy to generate hot water of 200 litres capacity continuously for domestic applications. It is also planned to use thicker insulation prevents thermal radiation, which keeps the equipment cool outside even while it is burning inside. It is expected to remove the headache waste disposal and saves money.1310","Incineration is a waste treatment process which involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials, among different methods of solid waste disposal and management. Waste incineration turns the waste into ash, flue gas, and heat. Most of the ash is formed by the wastes inorganic constituents, and can take the form of solid lumps or particulates carried by the flue gas. Before being dispersed into the atmosphere, the flue gases need to be cleaned of gaseous and particulate pollutants.13101310Energy-recovery incineration is one of the main waste-to-energy methods. Incinerators minimize the solid mass of the initial waste by 80821185 percent and the volume by 95821196 percent, depending on the composition and material degree. The incinerator is the best choice due to a high calorific value of solid waste, which is a comprehensive economic analysis for improved waste management and usage in India.13101310Other advantages are13101.9Reduces Pollution: No chance of polluting local and groundwater sources, as in landfill. 13102.9Filters Capture Pollutants: The release of dangerous compounds, especially dioxin, has been a major concern associated with the incineration of solid waste.

In all countries, a nationwide lockdown was imposed in the wake of a formidable adversary, the Covid-19 pandemic. With the number of cases increasing exponentially, hospitals faced a dangerous shortage of life- saving equipment and personnel.13101310Inadequate health care facilities to non-availability of testing kits and labs, protective equipments and advanced medical equipment such as ventilators, India looked utterly unprepared to face the enormity of the crisis. However, the idea of developing an indigenous invasive ICU ventilator was one of the most challenging of its missions. To overcome the shortage of these devices, we dont have a good solution yet, that can help us fulfill this requirement. In regards to this situation, we wanted to design our own Arduino COVID -19 Ventilator. So, we have decided to make a small portable ventilator prototype using Arduino. It will also be capable of monitoring our health and provide data about our heartbeat and SPO2 levels. Our ventilator prototype uses a stepper motor that applies pressure on an air sack (BVM bag), thus pushing oxygen-concentrated air into the lungs. When the stepper motor comes back to its earlier position, pressure is released from the air sack (BVM bag), making it retain its original shape. This system helps to draw out CO2 from the lungs (similar to breathing in and out).1310","This project can be widely implemented in emergency response services, first aid kits, and the medical industry in the coming days. The portable ventilator can be a game-changer in saving human life in case of delayed medical response regarding emergency response kits. It can be implemented in every emergency response vehicle like Ambulances, Fire engines etc. Our main goal is to promote this project in hospitals, especially in remote areas, for a better emergency life support system.13101310However, many existing systems are available, but they come up with their drawbacks like accuracy, quality of screening, and pricing.1310During COVID treatment, some of the benefits of this proposed project are summarized as follows:131082269It works by paralyzing the muscles of the body temporarily.131082269This proposed system includes the muscles that allow us to inhale and exhale.131082269Once the anesthesia stops, the patient can breathe on their own and are removed from the ventilator.1310","The fused filament fabrication class of desktop 3-D printers spawned from the rapid self- replicating prototype is the most advanced manufacturing technology. These designs are manufactured in remote areas and on-demand as needed from readily available (and possibly recycled) materials. These 3-D printers are also readily constructed from widely accessible materials and simple tools.13101310Direct Beneficiaries: Our Institute CMR Engineering College is taking care of this Medchal-Malkajgiri district as a part of Mistry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), Government of India for the national program called Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA), to achieve sustainable development and better quality of life.

In the proposed system, the physical machine tool will be connected to the cyber world to develop Machine Tool Cyber Twin (MTCT). Varieties of sensors would be installed for data acquisition which subsequently would be transferred to the cloud for accessing different application software8217s based on Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to execute big data analysis. The results obtained as a consequence of data analysis will be utilized for better control the process so as optimize the machining performance and automatic diagnosis of critical components to avoid premature failure. Thus higher level decision-making is possible to offer more flexibility, improved output and enhance the predictability of the system. The CPMT is poised to face the challenges of the 21st Century by providing improved solutions to the shop-floor problems.","Machine Tool 4.0 is new generation machine tools that are smarter, well connected, more adaptive and autonomous for higher order decision making. MT 4.0 combines advanced automation, IoT, cloud computing together with AI  ML technologies to carry out intelligent functions in CNC machine tools. In the system, various MTConnect sensors collect and buffers real time data as dictionary. The Agent gets data as dictionary from the sensor, converts it to MTConnect standard XML, and responds back to the Cloud. An MTConnect Agent is a web server, accessible across the Internet. In the reformed workflow, all the requests for action coming from the upper layer of cloud will be HTTP requests. Subsequently, the Agent will translate the HTTP parameters to a dictionary format for the sensor to communicate with the manufacturing resource by the available media. After getting the request from the Agent, sensor fetches appropriate data from the machine, creates a dictionary with all available data and sends the dictionary back to the Agent. The Agent then converts the data dictionary into an MTConnect Standard XML format and publishes that XML. The published data sent to cloud Server for processing and analyzing the data using various application tools such as Machine learning, Data analytics, etc. This output will be sent back to the machine tool controller through web server for improved performance.1310131013101310","The proposed machine tool (MT 4.0) can revolutionize the machine tool industries and its users. Metal cutting and machine tools are part and parcel of the manufacturing industries. So the machine tools manufacturers as well as its users will be immensely benefitted by this new generation machine tools. Further, the concept of data acquisition and analysis for improved decision-making can also be used in other industries such as process plants.

The proposed research concentrates on three main visions of a guiding system but it is still not available in real world mapping. At first a tracking solution was designed based on the visual hybrid tracking approach for smart phones. The tracking and the guiding part of a reliable indoor navigation requests a 3D model of the environment. For that reason, a second vision of a 3D model generation algorithm will be implemented, which automatically creates a 3D mesh out of a vectored 2D floor plan. The third vision of FOV Path is designed to react not only to the position of the user and the target, but is also dependent on the view direction and the field of view (FOV) capabilities of the used device.

They are quite effective but are not audible everywhere to everyone and are thus quite inefficient.","Our solution shall reduce the pain of Airport Authorities in controlling and manipulating the passengers through their airports and shall visualize the passenger manipulation through the airports. It also increases the chances of accurately locating a passenger at times of a medical emergency and also at times of a security threat as no passenger shall operate inside an airport without a RFID band in their hand that will be clearly visible to security personals not to help them secure the premises but also for betterment of the passenger to navigate through the airport.

It is fact that the average number of people who tend to apply for a single job is 118, while only 20 of them get to be interviewed, due to the technical resources, time, and cost associated. In order to target the problem, this idea provides a platform to conduct an automatic video-based technical interview with the power of AI at the core. The platform will examine technical questions to the candidate and evaluate the answer based on the answer expectations given by the company. It generates a similarity score to signify whether the candidate8217s response is similar to the correct one or/and the company8217s expected answer. A consolidated report for the drive and an individual candidate report will be generated that can be further used to decide the company end. It assists the company in generating a summarized answer script of each individual candidate which they can further use to check/take into consideration in evaluating the candidates. AutoHire Platform doesn8217t require any human intervention to evaluate the answers of the candidate. The unique feature of the idea is the interviews can be conducted in huge numbers at the same time and could save millions of rupees. ","The AutoHire has the following objectives, Create a web-based solution to conduct virtual technical interviews with the candidates, To evaluate the interview using AI without any human intervention, Assisting companies to shortlist the right talent using candidates8217 interview performance, To conduct and evaluate multiple interviews seamlessly, and Ensure companies and students spend little time and resources getting campus interviews completed. AutoHire Platform is an Artificial Intelligence-based automated interview solution and a web-based application currently in development using python based web framework. The candidate can take his/her video interview using a smartphone, laptop, or personal computer. First, the system extracts the audio file from the video interview input using the FFMPEG library. Once the audio is extracted, a model is used to generate the text for the audio input and set to extract two sets of keywords. This text will be forwarded to the text-similarity model in which the Siamese BERT Networks generate a fixed-length embedding vector to generate the answer. This embedding vector will be compared with another embedding vector generated using the expected answer given by the company. Then, the system utilizes the cosine similarity technique to compare the embedding records and generate the score. This score will be taken to generate the average score answer and to recognize the capability of the candidate.","This AutoHire platform will enable the companies to run virtual campus technical interviews with the candidates without having a dedicated technical team to evaluate the candidate in the interview. According to the surveys conducted during the part of this application, it is observed that as a corporate company, it might end up spending 40 per candidate to complete the whole interview process. It includes platform cost, interviewer availability, and a lot of environmental factors. The proposed idea, the Autohire application doesn8217t require much environment setup since it has its own interface to record the candidate interviews. It also has its own evaluation architecture to evaluate the multiple candidate interview performances in the background smoothly without human intervention. AutoHire application will fit the use cases where it is required to conduct technical interviews for any job roles starting from the entry-level to the senior level, as the complexity of the questions can be controlled on demand. This application also helps individual candidates to prepare for the technical interview by using some of the pre-fetched questions on the internet. The candidate can answer the question and see his performance and compare his score and concentrate on the track he wants to progress for.","This idea can be utilized in all the companies and organizations involved with technical interview-based recruitment. Typically, the pandemic forced the hiring process to go virtual, as per the TechRepublic portal, it is fact that 86 of companies are conducting job interviews via videoconference.

The geometry of components that can be friction welded in production is confined to round, square or rectangular sections. Before 1991 it was not possible to use friction techniques to butt weld plates longer than 100 mm together. However, in that year, FSW was invented, and has gone on to be remarkably successful for butt-welding a wide range of aluminum alloys.The FSW technique was readily adopted by the aircraft, aerospace and transport industries involved in the fabrication of aluminum alloy components, due to the reproducible production of high integrity welds, in contrast with some conventional welding methods. Instead of rubbing the contact faces of two plates together to generate frictional heating, a different approach is taken in FSW. The heat is generated by using a rotating tool, which does not deteriorate in any way during the welding process. This rotating tool is forced into .the interface between the two plates, which are clamped tightly together. The rubbing action of the tool generates sufficient heat to soften the plate material adjacent to the interface. Once a suitable temperature has been reached, the tool is translated along the length of the interface to join the plates together. A sketch of FSW in action.","The aim of our project is to design a tool holding device which simplifies the work and improve the accuracy of the welding. The working principle of our device is little different from other tool holding device of welding machine. The aluminum work piece is held in the vice. The two pieces of aluminum work piece is welded with the help high speed drilling head with friction tool. The working principle is very easy and at the same time production time is very much reduced. This machine is best suitable for mass production.Friction Stir Welding is a promising process and has clear advantages in terms of the mechanical properties of the welded material. FSW has already found great applications in the Aluminium industry. Therefore it becomes imperative to try to use it with other materials Including stainless steels. Friction Stir Welding provides a novel, relatively hazard free, solid phase joining process, which produces sound longitudinal joints, especially butt, in a range of materials and thicknesses. The FSW process is already in commercial use and has been found to be a robust, parameter tolerant, technique that has much to offer in the welding aluminium alloys.","LFW is commercially established as a technology for the fabrication of titanium alloy integrated bladed disks (blisks) in low temperature sections of aero-engine. LFW offers many advantages when used to manufacture blisks. For example, conventionally manufactured titanium alloy bladed disk assemblies are reliant on mechanical fixings and dovetail joints. LFW allows for the blade to be integrally joined to the disk, which significantly reduces the weight of the component. The lack of a mechanical interface between the blades and the disk also eliminates a common source for fatigue crack initiation, which is often the life limiting feature of these parts. Moreover, linear friction welded blisks offer better aerodynamic performance, which helps to lower the overall operating costs for the end user.Owing to the many benefits of LFW, the process is finding increasing industrial interest for the manufacturing of aircraft structural components. Metallic aircraft components are typically machined from oversized ingots, forgings and extrusions. This is an expensive process due to the proportionally large amount of material that is purchased compared to the amount that remains after machining. For example, buy1310-to-fly (BTF) ratios of 20:1 are not uncommon. LFW reduces the material required to make a component by joining smaller work pieces to produce a perform, which is subsequently machined to the desired dimensions.

",NOT YET,"Industrial wastewaters containing heavy metal ions such as As(III)/AS(V), Pb(II), Cd(II), Ni(I), Cr(III)/Cr(VI), Pb(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), Hg(I)/Hg(II), Co(II) etc. are directly or indirectly discharged into the streams, lakes, rivers or oceans. Usually, heavy metals cannot be decomposed or biodegraded. Marketwise water purifier is not properly removed such type of heavy metal ions. Now a day researcher are too much interested to developed environmental friendly polymeric materials that act as a good adsorbent for metal ions. Conducting polymer that contain free active functional groups (such as 8211OH, -NH2) act as a good adsorbent for metal ions due to complexation with free functional group. Nano structure conducting Poly(o-phenylenediamine) act as metal adsorbent due to its high active surface area and free amine/imine functional groups. The structure of the polymer like polyaniline with free NH functional group. Poly(o-phenylenediamine) with free 8211NH2 functional group also synthesized from phenylene diamine monomer in sulfuric acid medium in presence of APS as an radical initiator. So both polymer may be used for heavy metal detection and sensing purpose since these polymers are biodegradable and low cost for synthesis. ","Due to global warming and environmental pollution the underground water level gradually decreases and maximum part of India (like- Madhya Pradesh, Gujrat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Delhi) the scarcity of water is predominant as a result we have to recycle and reused the water liberated after household and industrial activity. Water having hazardous metal (like As(III)/AS(V), Pb(II), Cd(II), Ni(I), Cr(III)/Cr(VI), Pb(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), Hg(I)/Hg(II), Co(II) etc) are not only harmful for our health at the same time carcinogenic also. This heavy metal liberated as liquid effluent from paint, metallurgical and dyeing industries. Marketwise water purifier is not properly removed such type of heavy metal ions and also it is not applicable for large scale purification purpose. So for large scale and low cost, conducting polymer based water purifier have more effective. Poly(o-phenylene diamine) with free amine functional group act as a good adsorbent for heavy metal ions.

Since this disease is most common in elderly subjects, an ideal biomarker for dementia screening has to be reliable, predictive, reproducible, non-invasive, simple to perform, and inexpensive. The currently available biomarkers are including structural and functional neuroimaging, genetic factors, and biochemical analysis of blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Alzheimer8217s disease (AD), is the most common form of dementia. And there is similarity between the retinal and cerebral microvasculature. The available retinal imaging modalities are fundus camera imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The development of higher-quality and faster OCTs allowed clinicians to examine individual retinal layers with greater detail. Only trained technicians can perform segmentation, identify features or delineation of boundaries of retinal layers to allow measurements. This process involves time and fatigue factors. For small studies, it is reasonable, and provides the benefits of accuracy and precision. For mass screening  to be feasible, a more streamlined process is necessary In ophthalmology, deep learning has been applied to automated diagnosis, segmentation, big data analysis, and outcome predictions. One of the important AI-based applications in ophthalmology.","According to the Dementia India Report  by the Alzheimer8217s and Related Disorders Society of India (ARDSI), there were around 3.7 million Indians with dementia in 2010 with the number projected to rise to 7.6 million by 2030.The condition of retinal vessels has capability of reflecting the condition of the cerebral vasculature. It is found that anatomically and developmentally, retina is an extension of the brain. The fundus camera photography is used to measure, observe, and quantify microvascular retinal features and abnormalities.The other retinal imaging modality is Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT). OCT is a non-invasive imaging tool that can produce three dimensional cross-sectional images of the retina and permits precise and accurate measurement of the thickness of individual retinal components diagnosis can be done by trained people only. The solution is automated segmentation of images. Recent image processing technological breakthroughs with  computing power has led to deep learning, a relatively new subfield of machine learning that involves convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 1310Objective :To capture the images of the eye using fundus camera and OCT1310To analysis the image using deep learning 1310To identify the significant features for discriminating the severity of the disease1310To validate the features using clinical scores and brain image features 1310","According to WHO 2050 up to 131 million people would suffer from Dementia. In spite of the advances in understanding of pathogenesis and clinical practice , the availed  clinical treatments are limited. Most of the patients have advanced AD followed by irreversible neuronal damage. Hence there is need for early intervention can slow the progression of AD. Epidemiologic study shows one-year delay in the onset of AD would reduce the projected global burden by 9 million. The elderly subjects are finding difficulty in neuro imaging for continuous treatment and mass screening. The proposed process is alternative for mass screening of the Alzheimer8217s. The proposed work will be easy for mass screening of the prelevant disease It can be used in the dementia specialized hospitals and used by neuro doctors  1310","The markrt potential is 5.5 crores in India .It is estimated that In India alone number of subjects affected by dementia will exceed 14 million by 2050. There is a crucial need for a additional precise and prior diagnosis of AD. The gold standard methods like PET are affluent and invasive, making mass screening problematic. The eye-based biomarkers are a novel area for AD diagnosis as the ocular region has many similarities, both neural and vascular, with the brain. In this work the prominent features were thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer , deposits of Aß  and changes in retinal vascular parameters such as narrowing of the vessel and reduced blood flow. The literature study emphasises the need for earlier diagnosis and, hence, AD8217s treatment due to the evidence that retinal alterations occur early. Using the retina is an easy, non-invasive way to diagnose and manage AD when it is still in the early stages. The market potential is high in the Hospitals, neuro clinics, research centres and educational centres of study of dementia.The cost of examination by proposed method is cheaper that current existing techniques ,affordable, easy, noninvasive.

50,IDEAAP003002,GANDURI VENKATA SIVA RAMAKRISHNA,ANDHRA PRADESH,GUNTUR,Agro-industrial residues utilization for economical production of Levan biopolymer,"Levan was secreted extracellularly from sucrose-based substrates by wide variety of   bacteria, including genera Acetobacter, Bacillus, Erwinia, Gluconobacter, Halomonas,   Microbacterium, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Zymomonas. Each of these bacteria have   utilized different (synthetic) sucrose and (natural) sucrose-containing substrates for their   growth, levansucrase synthesis and produced varied levan yields. But this idea does not use   any of existing intellectual property. The current idea utilizes Jaggery, agro-industrial residue,   a conventional non-centrifuged, unpurified and concentrated sugar cane product, containing   75-80 sucrose as raw material for levan production in pilot-scale conditions, using   Halomonas variabilis. The produced Levan has numerous properties like chemical and water   holding capacity, viscosity, film formability, capacity to dissolves in oil and water, chemical   resistance and heat stability, which draws it as an extraordinary biopolymer.  ","Biopolymers find enormous applications in today8217s era. For the past few decades, numerous uses have been identified for Levan polysaccharide, but only limited numbers have been commercially realized due to non-availability in meaningful quantities. While Levan production in laboratory is straightforward, bottlenecks in the downstream process have hampered its scale-up. Technical issues like large volumes of alcohol, impracticality of dialysis on a large scale and unavailability of ultrafiltration equipment have complicated the Levan purification. The unique combination of properties that distinguish Levan from most other polysaccharides has long attracted attention. Effective and economical strategies for the production and purification of such biopolymers increases the extent of their usage in industrial, medicinal and commercial cosmetic sectors which is eco-friendly and raises no environmental or health concerns on plant, animal and human life. Although, Levan was produced extracellularly by wide range of microorganisms, its production was significantly affected by fermentation conditions. The novel Halomonas variabilis is known for its ability to produce high quantities of water-soluble biopolymer, when grown on sucrose, can be grown on low-cost agro-industrial residues like syrups, molasses, pomace, etc. for more economical production of Levan. So, the present idea is to develop an economical production (including purification) process and its applications.","Agro-based industries all over the world rely heavily on the supply of raw materials from farmlands. These industries, after production generate huge tonnage of agri-industrial wastes that are improperly disposed of and cause environmental pollution and serious health threats to animals including humans.  The utilization of these agro-industrial wastes to produce useful products emphasizes their biotechnological potentials for efficient value addition. In India, there is a problem dealing with large quantities of agro-industrial wastes that are generated from agro-processed raw materials, which the agro-industries essentially do not have any use for. Rather, these wastes are poorly disposed of into the environment, either at the backyards of the agro-industrial plants or are cart away by waste management companies to landfills to rot. The proposed idea is designed to carry out up- and down-stream process of Levan fermentation using Halomonas variabilis MTCC 3712 on agro-industrial residues. In the first stage, a variety of agro-industrial wastes/ residues such as syrups, molasses, pomace, carobs, Jaggery, etc. will be used to produce Levan in bench-scale conditions. Further, fermentation will be carried out in a pilot-scale reactor and improve yields, reduce economics involved in Levan biosynthesis. Further, the powder will be collected into heat-sealable plastic bags and these bags will be kept inside an air-tight container with silica gels, for further release into markets.","Though microbial Levan can be synthesized from sucrose as carbohydrate substrate, several agri-industrial wastes/ residues (that are rich in sucrose content) could be utilized with ecological soundness, economic advantages and low or negative costs. The major obstacles of efficient recovery of microbial polysaccharide lies in the energy consumption and operating costs involved in polysaccharide recovery. Further, these would open the new ways for further elucidation of Levan recovery in cost-effective manner and promotes the usage of purified Levan elaboration in industrial, medicinal and commercial cosmetic sectors. In this way, regional development seems to feasible with creation of small and medium enterprises (SME8217s) that will give rise to new jobs and protect environment from pollution. The present market price of highly purified Levan is ?20,000 per gram and is imported from USA in 1- or 2- or 5-gram bottles. Currently, there is no Indian Biotechnology company is producing this Levan due to low yields. So, the present invention addresses the following questions, in an elaborate manner: (i) Utilization of all agro-industrial residues as substrates to produce microbial Levan under submerged conditions (ii) Economical and novel production strategies to explore for Levan commercialization (iii) New purification strategies employed to obtain the synthesized Levan in a cost-effective method.","Levan biopolymer possess excellent general properties like bio-compatibility, bio-degradability, renewability, flexibility and exhibits biomedical properties such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenesis, anti-AIDS, hyperglycemic inhibitor, etc. Potential applications of this biopolysaccharides include as prebiotic effects, anti-tumor effects, cholesterol-lowering effects, eco-friendly adhesive, thickener in food industry as stabilizer, emulsifier, sweetener and flavor enhancer in beverage industry as biomaterial purifier, nanofilms/composites in biotech industry as immunostimulant, anti-inflammatory agent in biomedical industry as excipient, emulsifier, encapsulating agent in pharmaceutical industry. Levan has numerous demonstrated used in food industry as film forming agent, prebiotic compound, as stabilizer in beverages in feed industry as modulator of human body functions (like anti-tumor activity, fluid stool, immunostimulatory, etc.) in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries as an active ingredient, moisturizer in medicine industry as blood plasma expander, cryoprotectant, and also in agriculture industries.

53,IDEATN003009,Partheeban,TAMIL NADU,KANCHIPURAM,AIR-PURIFYING PAVER BLOCKS USING NANOCOMPOSITES,This is one of the new idea in manufacturing paver blocks. Since it reduces the air pollution in the admosphere.,"1310The air purifying approach is a promising new idea in the cementitious materials field, with the potential to create a new strategy to maintain a cleaner city by reducing air pollution in metropolitan areas. The photocatalytic reaction has the potential to accelerate natural oxidation and pollutant breakdown.1310Air pollution in India is a major problem, 27 of air pollution is caused by vehicular emissions. The major pollutants released from Vehicles are carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (NO), photochemical oxidants, etc. Such pollutants can be reduced by air-purifying paver blocks. An eco-friendly approach to producing air-purifying paver blocks without the use of cement is to use geopolymer concrete. In this innovation, to produce photo-catalytic concrete paver blocks, fly ash is replaced partially with Titanium dioxide (TiO2) to accelerate the gain in strength in ambient temperature as elevated temperature curing involves higher energy. No water curing is required and the air purifier paver block is left at room temperature for curing. Titanium dioxide is a heterogeneous photocatalyst that absorbs nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) and converts them to nitrate ions (NO3), which are either rinsed away by rain or soaked into the concrete to create stable compounds. Titanium dioxide improves the effectiveness of photo-degradation of air pollutants. Titanium dioxide is a semiconductor material that acts as a photocatalyst and initiates the reaction.","Air purifier paver block leads to minimization of air pollution that hereby decreases the harmful effects of those gases to a certain extent by photocatalysis. When nanomaterial like TiO2 is incorporated in concrete paver blocks, air purification process can be done automatically because of the photocatalytic action. When nano air-purifying paver blocks are exposed to solar and ultraviolet (UV) light, photocatalysts degrade organic and inorganic contaminants into less hazardous forms. The use of photocatalysts in combination with cementitious materials has several advantages. It has the potential to dissolve undesirable organic compounds on concrete paver block surfaces, which are easily washed away by rain. 1310OBJECTIVES13101.9To design, develop and implement the air purifier paver blocks using nanocomposite materials to minimize pollutant levels in the atmosphere and hence eliminate photochemical smog. When nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) combine with sunlight, photochemical smog is created, resulting in brown clouds. 13102.9To design and arrive an optimal mix proportion to achieve a maximum strength of air purifying paver block using nanocomposites in concrete as per IS 15658-2006 for Non-traffic to very heavy traffic conditions.13103.9To find out the percentage of harmful air pollutant reduction due to laying of nanocomposites-based air purifying paver block. 13104.9To design a permeable nanocomposites air purifier paver block  test its suitability","As per market demand quantity can be increased 8211 Approximately 5000 paver blocks can be produced per day per unit. Nano air purifier paver blocks find applications in pavements, footpaths, gardens, passenger waiting sheds, bus stops, parking areas, airfields, industry, and other public places. The product is commonly used in urban areas for the above applications. Hence, the unit may be set up in urban and semi-urban areas, near the construction activities. A lot of face-lifts is being given to roads, footpaths along the roadside. Air purifier paver blocks are ideal materials on the footpaths for easy laying, better look, and finish. It can be used in the foot path of parks which will be useful in reduction health effect due to air pollution such cough, asthma, cancer and breathing problem to a greater extent. 1310The excellent engineering property and durability of eco-friendly nano air purifier paver blocks extend its versatility for construction and building roads, building pavements, dams, reservoirs, underwater works, canal lining, irrigation work, etc. Enormous amounts of fly ash are usable in all the states in and around thermal power stations. The demand for pervious paver blocks could be fulfilled by setting up small units near thermal power stations and satisfying local demand with fewer transport costs.1310","Paver blocks have been extensively used in a number of countries for quite some time as a specialized problem-solving technique for providing pavement in areas where conventional types of construction are less durable due to many operational and environmental constraints. Air purifying paver blocks gives a solution for environmental pollution issues and it is a new approach in the construction of pavement using Interlocking Paver Blocks. Nanocomposites that are incorporated in paver blocks provide a solution for environmental pollution due to their photocatalytic action.  Air purifier concrete blocks are cost-effective and give good strength and durability when compared to ordinary paver blocks. A properly designed and constructed air purifier paver block gives excellent performance when applied at locations where conventional systems have lower service life due to a number of geological, traffic, environmental and operational constraints. It is applicable for light, medium, heavy, and very heavy traffic conditions. Mass production under factory conditions ensures the availability of blocks having consistent quality and high dimensional accuracy. Maintenance of air purifier paver blocks is easy and simple and it is not affected by fuel and oil spillage due to the photocatalytic action. A very high market demand is there for the air purifying paver blocks. It can replace the existing paver blocks and have high market demand."," Y J Breetha, Assistant Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, Chennai Institute of Technology, Kundrathur, Chennai 600069","M.E., (Ph.D) 8 years","Y J Breetha, breethayjcitchennai.net, 9962425238","We have prepared Nano air purifier concrete paver block with selected mix designed in such a way that it attains the required strength and permeability without compromising each other.

Moreover, this pulse width modulated voltage source inverters produces modulated voltages rather than pure sinusoidal voltages, results in poor power quality and common mode voltage issues. Hence these inverters demand ac side filters lead to increase the size, cost and volume of the system.  1310Proposed inverter utilizes small passive components between input and output side to provide the required voltage gain, leads to reduced DC bus voltage requirement and results in the safety, leakage current and voltage stress on the device problems. Moreover, the same passive components provide good decoupling between DC and AC, and ensures pure AC voltages without need of additional filters on AC side. Which in turn reduces the cost, size, volume and power quality issues. 1310","This inverter has several unique features, such as a) designed with lower number of elements and small passive elements, b) time delay circuits for dead band generation will not affect the power quality, c) reduces the voltage  stresses on the capacitor, d) offers better power quality (very low voltage and current THDs) without any ac side filter and e) reduced voltages stresses on power semiconductor devices.

Both mother and father must pass the defective form of the gene for a child to be affected. If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one normal haemoglobin gene and one defective form of the gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both normal haemoglobin and sickle cell haemoglobin. Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don39t have symptoms. They are carriers of the disease, however, which means they can pass the gene to their children.13101310Objective:13108226To develop a non-invasive portable integrated circuit for improving the chromatography techniques for sickle cell anaemia diagnosis.13108226To detect sickle cell features in the blood as early as possible in order to prevent disease spread.13108226To map the prevalence of the sickle cell gene in different tribal groups and within the tribal group that spread over the large area.","The proposed innovation would be an alternative for the following treatments:1310(a) Blood transfusions- In a red blood cell transfusion, red blood cells are removed from a supply of donated blood, then given through a vein to a person with sickle cell anaemia. This increases the number of normal red blood cells, which helps reduce symptoms and complications. Risks include an immune response to the donor blood, which can make it hard to find future1310donors infection and excess iron buildup in your body. Because excess iron can damage your heart, liver and other organs, if you undergo regular transfusions, you might need treatment to reduce iron levels.1310(b) Stem cell transplant- Also known as bone marrow transplant, this procedure involves replacing bone marrow affected by sickle cell anaemia with healthy bone marrow from a donor. The procedure usually uses a matched donor, such as a sibling, who does not have sickle cell anaemia. Because of the risks associated with a bone marrow transplant, the procedure is recommended only for people, usually children, who have significant symptoms and complications of sickle cell anaemia.The procedure requires a long hospital stay. After the transplant, you will receive drugs to help1310prevent rejection of the donated stem cells. Even so, your body might reject the transplant, leading to life-threatening complications.1310But, the cost of bone marrow transplantation in India starts from 15000 USD.",The proposed device can able to provide the following key deliverables:13108226 Secure the extinction of tribal society from sickle cell disorder13108226 Early detection of the sickle cell traits among the collected samples to improve the life span of the tribal13108226 Non-invasive method in the place of surgical options will reduce incision made on the patients13108226 Real-time deterministic control using FPGA to interface with different age groups of factitious community 13108226 Assistance for effective SCD treatment by categorizing the genetic variants of sickle cell anaemia using FPGA13108226 Use of FPGAs in diagnosis can directly affect the life safety of  SCD affected tribal and high requirement of safety and stability,"Dr.K.Raghu  Consultant Haematologist, Arunodhaya Medical Center, Coimbatore","30 years and MD(PGI), Dip.Haem",6381992932,Field visits to native tribal communities in and around Nilgiri districts were completed and collected the samples.

Conventional plastics once produced are non-biodegradable and takes decades to decay, while more plastics are dumped cause serious concerns on the health of the inhabitants of the world.  1310Bioplastics though being a good source of alternative to the conventional plastics, manufacturing of the bioplastics involves use of chemicals and components that pollute the environment not being 100 percent eco-friendly. Eco-friendly and cost effective alternatives are required to create a world free of plastics. Hence we propose a 100  eco-friendly bioplastic composite from abundant agricultural wastes that could be employed in manufacturing films for plastics bags and food parcels, mainly to use as single-use disposable hospital bed covers with 0 percent toxicity.  1310","The effects of bioplastics on marine life have raised red flags. A polymer PLA can leach toxic chemicals. PLA plastics are generally made from the sugars in cassava, corn starch, or sugarcane.  This is the same material that was found to contain toxicity levels similar to that of petroleum-based plastics like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyurethane (PUR). This is because thousands of chemicals are used to make plastic, and some are added to PLA to make it behave like plastic.  1310We investigate the combination of rice straw powder and seed polysaccharide powder as a binder instead of artificial plasticisers, along with other natural additives.  Rice straw powders have already been researched for mechanical strength of the dry and wet powder that was well comparable to polystyrene in dry state and similar to plasticized poly (vinyl chloride) in wet state as cast material. The novel combination of natural raw materials, that are available in abundance, could benefit in providing a cost effective alternative for plastic and could prevent environmental pollution.  1310Objective:1310Development of a cost effective, environment friendly bioplastic made out of agricultural waste mainly comprising rice straw and seed kernel powder available in abundance, to favour bioplastic production along with agricultural waste management. ","The estimated market growth of biodegradable plastics is considered very low, since the cost of manufacture is high, but expected to grow rapidly in India and China, since current studies reveal the rapid progress in the area of research.  1310The novel bioplastic film could be used in the production of eco-friendly bio-plastic bags, water bottles, films for food packaging, and especially for hospital waste disposal and hospital bed covers to prevent communicable diseases.","The global bioplastics market size was valued at 5.8 billion in 2020, and is projected to reach 16.8 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.5 from 2021 to 2030.

71,IDEAAP003135,Prakash Kodali,TELANGANA,WARANGAL URBAN,Smart Electronic Handheld Device for Non-Invasive Drug Delivery,"Yes, we got published design and technology in patent and FER under process for the   proposed devcie. Further development can be done and more other patents and publications   produced. Details of the published patent are attached at the end of the document. ","Transdermal Drug Delivery System has been used extensively nowadays revolutionizing the biomedical industry serving its purpose of the low-cost medication. Even though there are various ways of drug delivery systems counts to eight, out of all, the most commonly used are oral and intravenous drug delivery systems. But the main disadvantage of these systems is a first-pass effect, in which the concentration of drug gets reduced before it gets into system circulation. So, in order to counteract this, a transdermal drug delivery system came into existence. Iontophoresis is one of the mechanisms used for transdermal drug delivery where a small amount of electrical impulse generated by an external source is used to penetrate the drug into deeper layers of the skin.1310The development of more sophisticated drugs has demanded the need for more sophisticated methods to deliver those drugs. One of such methods is Transdermal Drug Delivery System. This method uses skin as a barrier to deliver the drug directly into the bloodstream. It increases the therapeutic efficiency and provides the drug at a controlled rate. However, the present available transdermal patches internally have the current generating circuit to be discarded after a few uses. So, the aim of this is to separate out the current generating circuit and make it a device so as to make it reusable and cost-effective. Electronics can be reused and electrode patches can be discarded after one use to save subject power.","The objective of invention: To design a reusable, cost-effective transdermal electrode system as a portable device and development of transdermal patch in order to address the adverse effects of oral and intravenous drug delivery methods. 1310Summary of the invention: 1310?9The developed Transdermal drug delivery device has been tested unethically and yielded fruitful results. This has been found very useful in the case of injecting drugs to infants and diabetic patients. 1310?9The cost of the device is low so that it is available to all kinds of people which is the main advantage of this invention. 1310?9Tuning of current irrespective of skin type is possible, an added advantage.1310?9The device can be made compact by integrating the components onto a PC board, thus making ","The present invention relates to the research in transdermal drug delivery systems. It has marked a significant and revolutionary change in the biomedical industry and made substantial contributions by its ever-growing advancements in the delivery of existing and novel drugs. However, the presently available iontophoresis systems are heavy, expensive, and are available with the patch but after a few uses, these have to be discarded along with the patch. So, a portable, battery-operated, low-power, reusable, and cost-effective system is developed as a device that can be used with the transdermal patch to inject the drug into the bloodstream. It can be tuned to 100 µA - 4 mA for a load of 100 O - 12 KO. Here, a constant current can be maintained over a wide range of load (skin) resistances which make it advantageous over other systems.  1310Potential Areas are the Health sector and improvement of quality of human life. This device is highly useful in the case of diabetes patients as they take insulin injections frequently and plays a major role in infants as their veins are very thin as it is a difficult task to inject the drug through conventional methods. 131082269This is a reusable, cost-effective, portable device131082269The inclusion of a potentiometer in the device has the added advantage of protecting the skin from the adverse effects of high currents if any. 131082269The patch used here are of low cost (less than 5 Rs) and can be discarded after one use.","There is a huge market potential for this,1310?9Diabetic patients more than 70, and on regular basis, it is needed,1310?9For infants and old people the needle-less/non-invasive technique will be effective.1310?9Expected mothers can use it very effectively in their routine process.1310?9The common ill, mentally challenged subjects can be used effectively. 1310To variants can be provided to get market: 1310?9For electronic flexible patch, inbuilt battery and circuitry is 200 to 300 Rs range.  1310?9For electrode flexible patch (less than 5 Rs), and one-time external banded battery and electronic device circuitry (400 to 500 Rs) range.1310So, with the above-said device models, we can touch millions of subject people.1310In UK and USA, these patches are sold for 100 dollars for 4/5 numbers.1310In India, we can generate money at the rate of Millions of sales electronic smart devices (300/400 Rs) and billions of use and thorough simple drug hold patch (5 Rs.","1.

Also, nano-copper/zinc can increase jute fibre strength with reduced water absorbance. Similarly, coating of fibres with some specific nanomaterials may make it flame resistant or fire retardant. There are reports of developing cotton fabrics which have fire retardant qualities. However, fire retardant jute fabrics have not yet been developed by coating nanoparticles. Therefore, development of nanocoated fire retardant jute fabrics will be unique in the jute sector.","To impart some desirable attributes to the fibres, nanoparticles will be used for coating to create nanocomposite materials. Polymer, CNTs, organophosphorus, boroxosiloxane, montmorillonite, Sb3O2 etc. will be used for imparting fire retardant properties. Alternate adsorption of polyelectrolyte amino-functionalized multiwall carbon nanotube (MWNT-NH2) and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) onto jute fabrics will be specifically tried to make it flame retardant.1310Objective: To develop nanomaterial coated/integrated fire retardant jute fabrics1310","India accounts for more than 50 of global jute production.

81,IDEAOD003216,SIDHARTHA SANKAR KAR,ODISHA,CUTTACK, A new and improved industrially viable manufacturing process for Gabapentin,It does not involve in existing intellectual property. The process envisaged is completely new.,"The present invention relates to an industrially viable manufacturing process for preparation of gabapentin, in particular to a process for preparation of gabapentin by green chemistry approach using continuous flow chemistry. The present process is simple, and can reduce the purification process of intermediates, reduce the production cost and obtain the product with higher purity. A novel process will be developed on 100 g scale for the preparation of gabapentin. Around Five synthetic routes have been developed by a number of companies to produce Gabapentin at industrial scale. All the described routes present some degree of concerns regarding safety. The implementation of cyanation and organometallic chemistry at manufacturing scales of gabapentin using batch equipment can be challenging due to the hazardous nature of the reagents employed, and the tight control of reaction parameters, including cryogenic temperatures, that help to afford acceptable selectivity and conversion for the desired reaction. Chemists working in a pilot plant often face safety issues during scale-up operations of gabapentin.  Application of continuous flow chemistry offers a means to mitigate the risk associated with handling large amounts of hazardous reagents and to better control the reaction parameters. Hence a facile system will be optimized to avoid solid accumulation and allow the preparation of the pure desired material over a working day using continuous flow chemistry.","Gabapentin is a synthetic analogue of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. It is used for the treatment of epilepsy, peripheral neuropathic pain, such as painful diabetic neuropathy. Gabapentin is among 53 highly essential key drug intermediates and bulk drugs that are hardly manufactured in India today. Many attempts have been made to develop a facile route for the synthesis of Gabapentin but most of them are having safety, purity and economic issues. Existing reported synthetic strategies for the preparation of gabapentin high mass and heat transfer performance is involved. Hence a continuous flow microreaction system has been envisaged to intensify the synthesis process of Gabapentin at relatively low temperature with lesser residence time. The present invention relates to pharmaceutical chemicals synthesis field, and in particular to a kind of continuous method for preparing Gabapentin and the process for purification. 1310Primary objectives: Process for preparation of gabapentin from readily available starting materials with simple preparation procedure, lower production cost, and higher purity following green chemistry approach. Development of a method to prepare 100 g of pure Gabapentin over a working day using continuous flow chemistry in microreaction system. Development of a facile route for the purification of intermediates and final product.  1310Secondary objective: Profiling of the major impurities produced during the process development of Gabapentin.","Gabapentin patents have already expired, and generic versions of the drug are widely available. Since the patent date already expired many Gabapentin manufacturers around the globe actively manufacture this drug. There are now over 300 different gabapentin drugs marketed worldwide. Gabapentin is one of the most highly prescribed medications, with over 44 million yearly prescriptions registered in the U.S. alone. So there is a huge demand for the Gabapentin bulk drug. However the production cost of the bulk drug is always a big challenge.  Recently the government of India has implemented the strategy to reduce dependence on China and be self reliant on the production of live saving and critical medicines throughout its production chain. Around 53 key drug intermediates and bulk drugs that are hardly manufactured in India today are being identified by the government on which our country will test self-reliance to fulfill the dream of Atma Nirbhar Bharat. The cost effective, safe and industrially viable manufacturing process for production of Gabapentin API will support the pharmaceutical manufacturing companies involved in production of Gabapentin formulations alone or in combination form and Pharmaceutical research organizations to a great extent. ","The Gabapentin and Nortriptyline market has witnessed growth from USD million to USD million from 2017 to 2022. With the CAGR, this market is estimated to reach USD million in 2029. Current India gabapentin (plain) market is 125 crore and total market including combination is 600 crore and it is expected to grow at a steady rate during the forecast period.  Gabapentin market can be segmented into epilepsy, neuropathic pain, restless legs syndrome, seizures, others. Among these, neuropathic pain segment is expected to witness high growth in the market over the coming years on account of high growth in the number of population having chronic progressive nerve diseases. A group of French researchers in 2021, reported that neuropathic pain may either indirectly result from COVID-19 or may be directly caused by the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the nervous system. Hence the efficient use of Gabapentin for the treatment of neuropathic pain is expected to drive this segmental growth in the years to come and there will be a high demand for Gabapentin bulk drug. Gabapentin alone and its combination forms are considered costly medicine and this attributes to the high cost the Gabapentin bulk drug. Hence a process that yields efficient large-scale production of Gabapentin bulk drug and its key intermediates under safe, green and reproducible conditions at low price would fulfill the market demand especially Indian market.

We gathered information by wireman those who are involved in the maintenance work of transformers and electric poles. There is a chance of wireman to get electric shock if incase they not properly demagnetize the electric circuit by opening .,"The three phase transformer consists three transformers either separate or combined with one core. The primary and secondary of the transformer can be independently connected either in star or delta. There are four possible connections for a 3-phase transformer bank.The magnetising current and voltage drops in impedances have been neglected. Under the balanced condition, the line current is a v3 times the phase winding current. In this configuration, the corresponding line and phase voltage are identical in magnitude on both primary and secondary sides.The secondary line-to-line voltage is in phase with the primary line-to-line voltage with a voltage ratio equal to the turns ratio.If the connection of the phase windings is reversed on either side, the phase difference of 180° is obtained between the primary and the secondary system. Such a connection is known as an 180º connection.The delta-delta transformer is satisfactory for a balanced and unbalanced load.If one transformer fails, the remaining two transformers will continue to supply the three-phase power. This is called an open delta connection.If third harmonics present, then it circulates in a closed path and therefore does not appear in the output voltage wave.The phasor diagram of the ?-Y connection of the three phase transformer is shown in the figure below.

This connection is called 8211 30° connection. This connection has no problem with the unbalanced load and thirds harmonics. The delta connection provided balanced phase on the Y side and provided a balanced path for the circulation of third harmonics without the use of the neutral wireBy reversing the connection on either side, the secondary system voltage can be made to lag the primary system by 30°. Thus, the connection is called -30° connection The Y-Y connection is not satisfactory for the unbalance load in the absence of a neutral connection. If the neutral is not provided, then the phase voltages become severely unbalance when the load is unbalanced.1310The Y-Y connection contains a third harmonics, and in balanced conditions, these harmonics are equal in magnitude and phase with the magnetising current. ","PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION: To open the LT line,open the AB switch(Air break switch)on the transformer.In the transformer, the three phase line is connected with the moving contact.For the maintenance, all the three moving contacts of transformer should be in open.Incase by error if any one moving contact didn8217t open properly means the wireman might experience electric shock.SOLUTION OFFERED:To avoid getting exposed to the electric shock,wireman can use our LTLC detector which detects the electromagnetic radiation from the fixed contact which carries.The star-delta connection of three phase transformer is shown in the figure above. The primary line voltage is v3 times the primary phase voltage.

The rating of the transformer bank is reduced to 58 of that of the actual bank. This is known as the open delta or V-V delta. Thus, in open winding transformer, two transformers are used instead of three for the 3-phase operation. thus Let the Vab, Vbc and Vca be the voltage applied to the primary winding of the transformer. The voltage induced in the transformer secondary or on winding one is Vab. The voltage induced on the low voltage winding two is Vbc. There is no winding between points a and c.

The balanced three phase line voltage produced balanced 3-phase voltage on the secondary side.If the three transformers are connected in delta-delta configuration and are supplying rated load and if the connection becomes V-V transformer, the current in each phase winding is increased by v3 times. The full line current flows in each of the two phase windings of the transformer. Thus the each transformer in the V-V system is overloaded by 73.2.

99,IDEAKR003311,Nitin Krishnan,UTTAR PRADESH,GAUTAM BUDDHA NAGAR,Colwho - Electric powered modern sugarcane juice cart,The idea does not involve use of existing IPR,"Colwho is conceptualised as an electric-powered sugarcane juice cart designed to replace the traditional diesel-powered juice carts.1310To be designed from scratch with human-centered design principles, the cart operators will get hygienic carts, increased juice extraction and more customer footfalls due to attractive visual design. The cart will use electric power (electric charging  solar module) to drive the juicing operations and for the locomotion of the cart itself. The possibility of integrating juice chillers or ice boxes will also be explored.1310Not only will each Colwho eliminate 10 kg of Co2 emissions per day per cart, but it will also integrate services with the physical product (cart) to improve the operators processes and experience. By encouraging customer spending through digital payment (UPI/e-wallets), earning of each operator will be tracked, enabling them to access financial services (loans, insurance etc.) through different partners.1310The business will generate its revenue from cart leasing by juice operators. Based on anecdotal evidence, an average cart operator incurs between INR 12k-15k towards diesel in Delhi/NCR and a cart rent of around INR 5k-6k per month. This paying capacity will be exploited for financing the monthly leasing of the electric powered juice carts. ","The juice being a summer favourite and highly recommended in ayurveda, fresh sugarcane juice cart, mostly running on diesel genset, are common sight across India. Colwho8217s objective is to improve the income and life of a sugarcane cart operator all the while also reducing air pollution.1310An average cart operator uses 4-5 ltrs (˜ 1 gallons) of diesel every day. As per US Environment Protection Agency, 1 gallon of diesel emits 10 kg of CO2 this is besides the pm 2.5, pm 10, nitrous and sulphur emissions from these diesel gensets. Thus, we aim to provide cleaner livelihood alternative to the juice cart operators.1310Secondly, the sugarcane stored on the cart is exposed to dust and street side pollutants and the juicer is subjected to flies and contaminants such as grease. While the benefits of fresh sugarcane juice are known, due to hygiene issues most consumers prefer carbonated drinks or packaged fruit juices. 1310Therefore, Colwho seeks to redesign the sugarcane cart through modern design principles and integration of electric powered mobility and juicing solutions. Also, based on the monthly revenue data per cart and through partnership with fintech companies, the operators may also access financial services like banking, credit, insurance etc. The monthly consumption data will also aid in the backward integration with sugarcane farmer. Can achieve three UN SDG (8, 12  13) goals: decent work  economic growth, responsible consumption  production and climate ","In accordance with the Government of India8217s 8220Aatmnirbhar Bharat8221 campaign and the target of net zero carbon emission by 2070, the electric-powered modern sugarcane cart 8211 Colwho 8211 will be used to convert traditional diesel-based carts into greener livelihood projects. By adding modern design aesthetics, the carts will be made more productive and appealing. This will ensure that consumers will be once again drawn to sugarcane juice carts. This will help protect existing jobs and at the same time provide new opportunity to seasonal workers. Secondly, by keeping tabs on revenue and sugarcane consumption at every location and for each cart, the income potential and inventory requirements will also be projected. These will be exploited to make the system efficient and provide greater services to the cart owner.","Based on anecdotal evidence, there are around 300-400 sugarcane carts in the Noida/Greater Noida region of Uttar Pradesh. With monthly expenditure on diesel at around INR 12k-15k, it is safe to estimate that sugarcane cart owners in this area pay between 35 8211 45 lakhs on diesel (approx. of 300 carts). Conservatively estimating that some 150 of them are also renting their carts currently for INR 5k-6k this figure comes to around 7.5 8211 9 lakhs. Thus, the total addressable market size in terms of revenue potential is between 40 8211 50 lakhs. If Colwho is able to attract 50 of the cart owners, then the monthly lease earning is between 20 lakhs 8211 25 lakhs in peak season (6 months) and between 16 8211 20 lakhs in lean period in the larger Noida region. 1310The business potential grows significantly if operations are scaled across tier-1  tier-2 cities of top sugarcane producing states in India, namely: Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Tamilnadu. 1310Another potential revenue can also be made from carbon offset.

This have features of moving the headlight along with motion of steering. In this technology we have used two headlights for any vehicle, one is moveable with steering and another will be fixed and give the front visibility. This is main uniqueness in this idea because it will save the life of many peoples who die due to sharp turn on hilly roads as well as ghat roads. Rack and pinion, recirculating ball, worm and sector Rack and pinion animation, Rack and pinion unit mounted in the cockpit of an Ariel Atom sports car chassis. For most high volume production, this is usually mounted on the other side of this panel. Many modern cars use rack and pinion steering mechanisms, where the steering wheel turns the pinion gear the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion). This motion applies steering torque to the kingpins of the steered wheels via tie rods and a short lever arm called the steering arm. The rack and pinion design has the advantages of a large degree of feedback and direct steering feel it also does not normally have any backlash, or slack.","The aim is to design and develop a “ Advance Steering controlled headlight Mechanism” which acts as directional headlights. This is done by connecting headlights and steering. Present-day automobiles don’t have an effective lighting system. Due to this many accidents are taking place during night times especially in ghat and Hilly sections. The accidents can be avoided by incorporating the Steering Control Headlight Mechanism. In this project we attached two headlights in which one will be fixed as usual and another will move according to rotation of steering at some angle. The rack and pinion steering gear mechanism is used for this project. When the steering wheel is rotated and rotary motion is converted to translatory motion through the rack and pinion mechanism. When the front wheels are steered, the headlights follow the same path and the light is focused on the more divergent area. In the present project, it is planned to design “Steering Controlled Headlight Mechanism” . Apart from turning the Headlights using cables mechanically, we can also turn this electrically using switches and cables as well. By introducing this Steering Controlled Headlights Mechanism, the Headlights cast their beam in the direction of the curve and ensure better visibility during night drives on ghat roads. This provides a smooth and safe ride, mind free ride for the motorist, and it is a safety system for an automobile.  ",Automobile industries have millions turnover in a year.

By employing the height parameter, solar tree requires less space consumption which can reduce the installation cost. Compared to the traditional solar farm which is oriented in a single direction, the multi-angle orientation parameter from the solar tree panels yields the potential capability to absorb higher sunlight intensity leading to higher output energy. At the same time, this parameter eliminates the necessity to install solar tracker which can reduce the operational cost. To increase the collection Generation of 1MW power from PV module system requires the land of 5-6 Acres approximately for housing the panels only. A tall pole-like structure would take only 1 of land area in comparison to general PV housing. In India there is scarcity of land in urban and even in rural areas. It can also be locked at any position to withstand the wind pressure due to heavy storm affecting over the main pole/ trunk. The panels will be naturally facing towards the sun at an angle as required so that they can collect maximum solar energy in a daytime. To get the maximum sun in a day time the top panel should not obstruct the bottom panels.","Solar Tree is an environmental enterprise, an ecological sculpture, an artificial solar structure that looks like sculptural trees and exists from small scale (size of a bonsai tree) to large scale (about the size of a wind turbine) power plant.

113,IDEATN003405,SHAIK ABDUL SUBHAHAN,TELANGANA,HYDERABAD,"DESIGN OF I-HEALTH USING NFC TAG FOR MONITORING, STORING AND ACCESSING PATIENT HEALTH INFORMATION IN SINGLE TAP",No. we have not  used the existing intellectual property ,Indian population is nearly 125 Cr. In parallel the rise of disease among peoples are increased consistently among people. In India most of the people are from rural area with less educational competencies. They are unable to explain about their earlier health information when are affected by an disease. Also physician depends on paper work for getting patient information apart from few digital data8217s that are available only in few hospitals. Hence worth there is an urgent need for new technology to store and retrieve patient information quickly. The launches of NFC tags are implemented at hospitals for storing and accessing individual patient health information using deputed NFC writer. This system works in a swift basis that stored huge volume of patient health information and converts are link and finally stored in NFC tag. When a patient approaches a doctor their entire health information8217s are retrieved in a single tap and then parallel updated after the present diagnosis process is completed. NFC is the recent charm in technological growth and provides way for upgraded inventions in the field of medical sciences. ,"Maintaining patient health related documents at hospital is a tedious process. Generally, health documents hold patient information and supports very few health-related information due to security constraints. This is because of health data confidentiality. Despite using few health based MIS it doesn8217t not quench valid information8217s.1310Apart from the primary issues, the next issues come in the aspects of updated health information. As the periodic monitoring of patient8217s health improves patients8217 health and the timely health-based information is not maintained digitally. All such information as stored in patient health booklet manually by the physician. Storing information as hard copy has its own constraint and in case of missed documents none of the information can be retrieved.1310The working principles of NFC act a medium of holding information about patient. This is done using NFC writer. The NFC writer is linked the health cloud that holds overall information of all the patients at hospital. 1310Every health tag holds patients8217 information and it can be read by NFC reader that are kept at the physician desk. When a patient walks in, his entire health information8217s are read by a single tap made at NFC reader. The update information8217s are stored back to the tag. 1310",The concept of cloud is introduced with a help of a url link then holds individual patients health information. An Admin at hospital maintains this file and periodic updates are made then and there for updated health content.1310This cloud is accessed between one or more centers of the hospital that holds common health information of the patients and his information is available between systems of all hospitals center.1310Such approach reduces overall paper works that are used to hold health information and it8217s now available in the form of health tag.1310One of the modern-day revolutions in IT sector is cloud computing. This concept is based on data and resource sharing for successful implementation of cloud computing in an organization. In this concept the implementation of private and public health cloud is launched and the patient8217s health data are accessed using NFC tag and RFID card. RFID acts as a medium for storing patient8217s information and the information are then linked with NFC tag. The tag is accessed using specific designed readers put up at physician8217s end that are devised to accessed patient information in a single tap. The periodic health related information are keyed and stored in a system web form and are finally stored in cloud. The information that are fed into tag in the form of URL link. Each and every link has patient health information with timely updates. ,This invention is to implement NFC tag concepts for accessing patient health-based information from cloud store. The role of NFC tag is to stored and read patient health information using deputed NFC reader. The NFC writer writes the information in the form of URL in NFC tag that8217s stored patient information. 13101310Still there are people who are not able to explain their health problem especially their early medical reports. The present invention mainly deals with patient health information retrieval using NFC tag and reader/writer. This system works for the patients who are not in the proper mind set to explain about their health problem and also not able to monitor their early medical reports.  This system works for all but especially for the rural people who are not able to explain their health problem due to lack of education. As India has more villages this system gives a perfect value-added service in the field of medical science. 13101310Deputed NFC reader and writer are involved in this process with an admin who operated at physician locations.1310,Dr.S.Arun  Professor ECE PEC  Dr.S.PadmaPriya  Professor CSE PEF,"M.E., PhD",9962562307,We have implemented the NFC tag in the simulation model and tested and also tried with hospitals for storing and accessing individual patient health information using deputed NFC writer.

For example, an incandescent bulb with a power rating of 100 W generates roughly the same lumens as Light Emitting Diode (LED) with a power rating of 10 W. Further, the Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) requires DC input voltage. When the LEDs are operated on an AC grid, a down conversion of the AC voltage to a DC voltage has to take place and which results in a loss of energy. Similarly, there are fans, televisions and other equipment8217s that are operated on DC and these equipments operated on DC are far more efficient than that of their AC counter parts. Another issue is the currently available grid-connected and off-grid solar systems comprise a solar panel and an inverter that converts an energy generated by the solar panel from direct current (DC) to a grid compatible alternating current (AC). In the case of an off-grid system, a battery bank is charged by the panels to supply a power during the switching off period of the grid power. Hence, there is a need for an intelligent and energy efficient DC off-grid solar system and a method for generating solar energy to the end user equipment.  Also, there is need for a system and method for delivering DC energy to the household systems efficiently.","Design of circuit which consists of a relay communicatively coupled to the controller. The controller with help of voltage sensor identify required voltage signal. If sufficient voltage signal is not obtained through solar panel, then relay changes the input source from solar panel to grid. Now the electronic device retrieves the input from grid after step down and converts DC using a rectifier. 1310Following are the objectives:1310?9To design an automatic switching electronic system which takes input from solar panel and in absence of solar energy from grid.1310?9To design a switch controller circuit to obtain off-gird DC energy continuously.1310?9To design a switch controller circuit to operate multiple DC Appliances like Ceiling Fan, Table Fan, LEDs, LEDTV8217s and LEDMONITOR8217s, Laptop etc., in group or single.

120,IDEATN003482,jegannathan r,TAMIL NADU,CHENNAI,"Aluminium-Air Battery Design, Fabrication and Testing",No,"In our project instead of using Li-ion in batteries, we have made the decision to use Aluminum as our main source. Aluminium batteries are better than their counterparts in terms of energy stored and energy produced, however, the drawback is that the corrosion rate of Aluminum is higher and the battery doesn8217t stop corroding even when it8217s not in use. This is why the current industry has only started testing this method recently. We have devised a way to stop this event up to a certain extent using the unique design of our Aluminum-Air battery and its compactness gives it a very practical approach that can be used in countless different situations. Our goal is to find a way to minimize the idle corrosion of the battery and increase its lifespan by using intelligent design simulations, additionally, in our prototype, we have the flexibility of changing the aluminium plates (anode) after it has been used/corroded completely and replacing it with new plates which avoid the task of disposing of the whole unit. This will ultimately prove to be environment friendly.","Our Concept provides us with the luxury to completely change the Aluminum Plates (Anode) without having to dispose of the whole unit where-in limiting the e-waste which has recently been a major issue in environmental conferences and international goals such as the SDGs (Sustainable development goals).1310Additionally, our prototype limits the corrosion of the Aluminum plates which tend to corrode even when they are not in use. With our design, we are using a physical barrier (cotton slate) which acts as the soaked electrolyte and makes contact between the Aluminum plates and the carbon mesh ultimately helping electrons to flow. This cotton slate is submerged into the electrolyte solution when the battery is idle, thus no contact is made between the plates and the carbon mesh which prevents the corrosion of the anode. Our objective is to make this Aluminum-Air battery ready for practical use and provide cheap, eco-friendly alternatives to existing technologies. 1310","With the current decline of fossil fuels, batteries are certainly going to be the replacement for it. Although lithium has been the go-to element for the production of batteries it does not come without its drawbacks such as depletion of the water table in the place of lithium mining, low charge density etc. Hence, with our innovation of an aluminium-air battery, we overcome those shortcomings and it can be used with the same versatility as lithium-ion batteries.","There can be potential demand for aluminium-air batteries due to the rise in demand for electric vehicles in the market since the aluminium-air batteries are reliable and have better characteristics when compared with the existing system and its parameters. The Aluminium-air battery mainly focuses on the Automotive sectors, Military, Consumer Electronics, Aerospace and others. Now, currently, countries like North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa hold a major share of the global Aluminium-air battery market.

125,IDEATN003519,Sivaranjani G,TAMIL NADU,KANCHIPURAM,Saffron cultivation using assorted modern techniques,Our idea involves the usage of vertical gardening and hydroponics to cultivate saffron so that it can be cultivated widely in parts of India.Vertical gardening allows to grow more plant in small land area. Hydroponics helps reduce soilborne illness of saffron. ,"In this idea modern gardening methods such as vertical gardening and hydroponics system is used to cultivate saffron. Here saffron is cultivated in a polyhouse setup where temperature and moisture can be maintained used artificially created mist. By this idea saffron can be cultivated widely in many places in our country. The Greenhouse Fogging System is also known as the misting system. It ensures that the moisture level remains at an optimal level for the photosynthesis required for plant growth. Misting systems use high pressure nozzles to form fine water droplets to cool the greenhouse. Pumped into the air, the tiny mist droplets remain suspended until they evaporate. Fog systems can be installed in any greenhouse configuration, such as  with natural or mechanical ventilation. Greenhouses equipped with exhaust fans also have very  good fog cooling capabilities. A line of mist nozzles is installed right inside the exhaust fan. The exhaust fan on the opposite wall draws outside air through the open vents and then through the fog, where the air is cooled. Pumps which provide fog droplets typically operate at 1,000 psi to 1,500 psi . Copper, stainless steel and re-enforced flexible hose are used for piping. Most fogging systems are based on high-pressure nozzles. The water usage per nozzle is approximately 1 to 1.2 gallons per hour. Temperature is maintained using control system. Fog catching nets: Fog catching nets are used to catch mist which are produced.","Our idea is to cultivate saffron widely in many parts of the country irrespective of physical  parameters using sustainable gardening methods. Here both soil agriculture and Hydroponic  system can be utilized. Polyhouse setup is used, in which cultivation is done using vertical  farming. Overall Production of Saffron in India will be increased. To develop and adapt  vertical and hydroponic system of farming. As it is labor intensive it creates employment  uniformly all over the country. The quality of saffron is maintained throughout the  cultivation process. Due to huge demand and high price saffron is targeted for adulteration  which will be reduced by this method.","Agricultural product used in food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.  Saffron is used in lot of industries. Along with being a major spice, it is also used in cosmetics.  raw material.  Food industry: Saffron is used as a natural food additive.  Pharma industry: It is not only used to treat Alzheimer’s disease and anti-tumor properties but it is  also used to treat arthritis, cardio vascular disease and various stomach disorder.

129,IDEAMH003537,Vaishali Arun Mutyalwar,MAHARASHTRA,NAGPUR,CEILING FAN CLEANING DEVICE,The Patent is filed at Indian Patent Office on 24th February 2022 and it is under examination. Patent application no. is 202221009936,"The field of the invention for the proposed work is for cleaning the fan blades of a ceiling fan. Cleaning devices of many shapes and sizes have been created for handling a variety of needs. Currently, there are no devices that allow a user to clean ceiling fan blades without the use of a ladder, step stool, or other elevating devices. ","Concept:  1310The present invention relates to cleaning devices and, more specifically, to a device that allows a user to clean both the top and bottom of a ceiling fan blade without the need for an elevating device of any kind. The invention may be adapted to work with a wide variety of 10 blade types, shapes, and sizes. It is the purpose and objective of the present invention to provide an improved means for safely cleaning both the tops and bottoms of ceiling fan blades without the need for ladders, step stools, or other elevating devices. It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a cleaning device for ceiling blades that will not, in any way, damage the blade, its finish, or fan mechanism through normal use. It is yet another feature and objective of the present invention to provide a one-piece cleaning cover that is easily installed for cleaning or removed for replacement. 13101310Objective: The main objectives of our innovative idea is:1310a)9To provide economic and efficient solutions for the  ceiling fan cleaning process.1310b)9To develop easy to operate and portable device. 1310c)9To improve to clean and eco-friendly environment in hospitals and government office.1310d)9To reduce the kati shoola or kati graham and considered to be an imbalance or vikrati in human body.1310e)9To provide comfort during cleaning of ceiling fan.1310","Ceiling type fans are extensively used in dwellings, offices and many other types of buildings to circulate air and reduce the cost of heating during cold weather and air-conditioning during hot weather. The blades of such fans, particularly on the top surfaces, become encrusted with a layer of dust that clings tenaciously to the blade surface and must be removed from time to time to maintain the full effective operation of the ceiling fan. In a conventional method of cleaning ceiling fans, a person will stand on a ladder or stool so the blades can be reached and then cleaned with a cloth or brush. Because such cleaning operations are so arduous to perform, a majority of ceiling fan blades remain uncleaned or are not cleaned nearly as often as needed. 1310The potential areas of given product are household appliances, hospitals, offices and whenever cleaning is required.","There are currently several varieties of apparatus for cleaning ceiling fans. Many of these have disadvantages for cleaning the upper surface of the ceiling fan blades, forcing the user to use a ladder or stool to reach the upper blade surfaces. Other cleaning tools require bulky vacuums or attachments which limit reach and mobility. None of these inventions gives the user a view of the top side of the ceiling fan blade being cleaned. Most of these inventions use a wiping or sweeping method with a fixed brush or cleaning surface to remove dust from the top side of the ceiling fan blade.1310The field of invention for the proposed work is for cleaning the fan blades of a ceiling fan. Cleaning devices of many shapes and sizes have been created for handling a variety of needs. Currently, there are no devices that allow a user to clean ceiling fan blades without the use of a ladder, step stool, or other elevating devices. 1310This project is having a wide scope in an organization like colleges, schools, corporate offices, government offices, hospitals, restaurants, hotels and households etc. Almost everywhere when cleanliness is required.1310Since our idea is to clean a ceiling fan, which is a new concept in the market.

131,IDEATS003551,Nagul Shribala,TELANGANA,HYDERABAD,Battery Management System,No,"Electric vehicles are set to be the dominant form of transportation in the near future and Lithium-based rechargeable battery packs have been widely adopted in them. Battery packs need to be constantly monitored and managed in order to maintain the safety, efficiency and reliability of the overall electric vehicle system. A battery management system consists of a battery fuel gauge, optimal charging algorithm, and cell/thermal balancing circuitry. It uses three non-invasive measurements from the battery, voltage, current and temperature, in order to estimate crucial states and parameters of the battery system, such as battery impedance, battery capacity, state of charge, state of health, power fade, and remaining useful life. These estimates are important for the proper functioning of optimal charging algorithms, charge and thermal balancing strategies, and battery safety mechanisms.","A BMS can measure different figures such as current, voltage, temperature, and coulomb count. With these measurements the system can assess the health of the battery and readjust operations as needed to protect the pack. For instance, a drop in cell voltage at a given load can indicate an increase in internal resistance. This then can point toward dry-out, corrosion, plate separation, or other diagnoses. A sudden increase in the temperature of one cell could indicate the possibility of a thermal runaway event within the whole battery pack. The BMS could then stop the flow of energy and alert the user to a potential problem so that it can be contained before it gets out of control. State of charge (SoC) and state of health (SoH) are important indicators for assessing the usability and capabilities of a battery. Together the SoC and SoH provide a state of function, an overview of the battery and the pack8217s capabilities as a whole.1310The proposed BMS is Bluetooth enabled/WiFi enabled. The battery voltage/ current, temperature is monitored. There is a provision of High and Low voltage protection. A monitor to display the range of voltages. The system also estimates SoC and SoH. The power is limited at input/output for thermal and over voltage protection, control battery charging profile and when ever required the battery pack may be isolated from source and load.  1310","The potential areas of application are Industrial machines, Electric train traction batteries, forklifts, garbage compressors, , lifts and cranes, robots, shuttle robots, electric street sweepers.

Moreover, growth in consumer demand to maximize vehicle efficiency and minimize fuel costs have led to consistent technological advancements in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. The need to optimize utilization of battery storage capacity in electric vehicles and to prevent dangers caused by overheating of battery in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, manufacturers have started to integrate battery management systems in vehicles.

We are going to analyse waste generated in Islampur city. As per results obtained we are proceeding further. Then we are going to preparation of model to carry out pyrolysis process. The product obtained will be in impure form which is like a diesel. After its further purification, we are getting petrol as a product. On the basis of result we are going to design Refused Derived Fuel System for Islampur City. ","India generates close to 26,000 tonnes of plastic a day, most of which is single use plastic. Most of it goes in dumping grounds around cities. Dumping ground around the metro city and developing cites are getting bigger day by day. Need of the hour is to create awareness regarding use and disposable of plastic and controlling plastic pollution and simultaneously cleaning the landfill of plastic. Due to decomposing of the food and natural matter Methane gas is produced in the dumping ground area. Islampur city is growing city with great increasing rate of population, generates total waste of 25tonnes per day. In that 6.72tonnes is dry waste out of which 0.5tonnes is plastic waste. Islampur city has solid waste plant near Islampur-Junekhed Road, Taluka Walwa, District Sangli, Maharashtra, India. Plant has area of 16 acres.  Due to some the reasons disposal of waste is not happening and nearly 15acres of land filled with the waste since last 4 years or even before that composting of wet waste is only done. There is number of heaps of waste dumped on site without any treatment. Data obtained from Mr. Aditya Chavan (municipal authority) and Mr. Ashok Hubale (Solid waste plant operater). To, overcome the problem and achieve environmental sustainability, necessity of the proposed work.","The pyrolysis is a complex process in which the different type of plastic is heated to higher temperature about 300ºC to 500ºC in absence of oxygen. At this high temperature, thermal cracking of the plastic start. After a period of time the plastic is melted down and steam is formed. This steam is condensed in the condenser with help of catalyst. Post condensation the output of the plant is in liquid, char and gas. Using pyrolysis, we can reduce plastic waste problem and provide an alternative fuel for local industrial application. Also, in this process create opportunity for employment in sub-urban and rural regions. Plastic waste collected is not same for all batch, so temperature cannot be specified for pyrolysis process. Pyrolysis Batch timing is ideally of 18 to 20 hours.1310Objectives: 13101.9To analyze municipal solid waste.13102.9To define scope of refused derive fuel. 13103.9Alternatives of refused derive fuel. 13104.9Design of refused derive fuel system for Islampur City.     1310","Wherein 80 of the plastic can be reused in some or the other form. 50 of plastic used in daily commute is single used plastic. Daily used of plastic can8217t be stopped as we don8217t have a cheaper alternative for plastic. The fuel which is produced from plastic pyrolysis can be used as alternative fuel for industrial application which will benefit small and micro industrials around India. Coal and wood is not preferred in most industries due to the carbon and smoke emission, depletion of forest and limitation of natural resources. This calorific value of the pyrolysis fuel is twice of the coal and wood. Further distilling of this pyrolysis fuel can give a fuel grade equivalent to jet fuel. But for now, we are planning on developing an economical yet highly efficient fuel for the masses.","India generates close to 26,000 tonnes of plastic a day, most of which is single use plastic. Most of it goes in dumping grounds around cities. Dumping ground around the metro city and developing cites are getting bigger day by day. Ex. Ghazipur, Delhi dumping ground is expected area of more than 40 football pitches and to surpass height of Taj Mahal by 2021. Need of the hour is to create awareness regarding use and disposable of plastic and controlling plastic pollution and simultaneously cleaning the landfill of plastic. Due to decomposing of the food and natural matter Methane gas is produced in the dumping ground area. Natural or manmade fires in dumping ground, ignites the methane gas and plastic acts as fuel in dumping ground. The burning of plastics releases toxic gases like dioxins, furans, mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls. Therefore a proper way of disposing plastic is need as fast, economical and efficient as possible. Humans are the only factor in environment which consume plastic at such Hugh quantity and we are massively depended on plastic in our daily commute. It is impossible to stop using plastic immediately. When speaking about benefiters in this process are almost everyone who uses plastic in direct or indirect manner. When we reduce presence of plastic from the environment pollutions falls dramatically. There are many industry where wood or other form of fuel is used which adversely affect environment. ","Dr. S.

It has cameras and sonic waves generator to distract the birds, reptiles and animals from the crop field without causing harm to them.","This system uses an effective device to avoid both animals and birds intruding in the land by generating various alert sounds for different kind of animals and birds. When the same output is repeated for a specific time period, it generates the sonic shield waves which drives away the animals and birds, meanwhile the alert message will also be sent to the farmers mobile number.","The animal/ birds intrusion into the agricultural land is detected by using video surveillance system. The outputs generated by video surveillance system will be transferred to the ARDUINO micro controller and the signal obtained is compared with the animal/ birds database through image processing techniques. Based on the output, frightening sounds to distract birds/animals and making them to move away from the farming land are generated from the sound sensor. When the same output is repeated for a specific time period, it generates the sonic shield waves and meanwhile the alert message will also be sent to the farmers mobile number. On the other hand the average value of temperature, humidity of the surrounding and the moisture content of soil will be measured using sensors placed in the soil. The entire information received from sensors will be sent to the ARDUINO and the information about atmospheric conditions will be sent to the farmer. The electrical power required to operate complete system will be generated by using the solar panel.The main objective is to reduce agricultural loss to the farmers due to invasion of animals and birds to their farm land. Crop cultivation is decreasing rapidly due to many reasons. To overcome this problem, crop monitoring and intelligent intrusion detection system will increase both the efficiency and profitability of crop production.",For farmers depending on agriculture for their livelihood.Security of designated areas.Markets related to agricultural equipments and products.,"Existing system creates losses to the lives of animals and birds.

The polluted water can cause various diseases to humans and animals, which in turn affects the life cycle of the ecosystem. If water pollution is detected in an early stage, suitable measures can be taken and critical situations can be avoided. To make certain the supply of pure water, the quality of the water should be examined in real-time. Smart solutions for monitoring of water pollution are getting more and more significant these days with innovation in sensors, communication, and Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In this paper, a detailed review of the latest works that were implemented in the arena of smart water pollution monitoring systems is presented. The paper proposes a cost effective and efficient IoT based smart water quality monitoring system which monitors the quality parameters uninterruptedly. The developed model is tested with three water samples and the parameters are transmitted to the cloud server for further action.","In general water quality monitoring system consists of various sensors such a pH sensor, turbidity sensors, temperature sensors, conductivity sensors, humidity sensors and many other sensors.

The proposed system is a sensor based hardware module which acquires various parameters like, wind velocity, temperature, humidity, pll of soil and give these inputs to an algorithm which was developed by creating a data base with various test cases.","There are a huge number of auto irrigation modules available in the market. The problem in with such modules is that, the cost of these products is too huge because the sensor modules have to be distributed all over the agriculture land. The existing systems dont actually consider any inputs, and cost about Rs 44, 000 for manual control Thus a majority of our farmers will not be able to afford it. The other problem with existing systems is that sensors are battery operated and once the sensor fails the module has to be replaced. Thus multiple sensor modules used in the field has to be replaced. Our system has tried overcoming this by designing a cost effective system to provide auto irrigation. Our system can work with a single sensor based module for approximately 1 acre area of agricultural land against whereas existing systems require 20 such modules for the same area The other advantage of our system is than no existing solutions provide details on fertilizer requirements and hence farmers use fertilizers even when not required This system can create a balance in fertilizer utilization.

According to NITI AAyog  Report. Water scarcity is going to be major problem in India. As we know, water can not be created but recycled.  Broadly, water crisis can be divided in scarcity of water and deliberate waste water discharge which in turn pollutes the fresh water streams. In the household around 80 percent water is used for the secondary purposes like bathing, flushing and cleaning etc. and 20 percent water is used for the drinking and cooking purposes. This 80 percent water is after uses go wastage in drainage and pollute to our mother rivers. So this waste water is creating 2 problems water scarcity and river pollution. Product working  concept - We have used water level sensor to on off the water pump. When the water will use even this system will automatically  on. This water will go to the filtration unit where solid impurities will trapped by natural sponge layer of 30 PPI. The this water will go to the next layer of filter bulb here the activated carbon will be in a pores layer so again solid impurities will be trapped and due to pores the surface area of layer will be increased so it will increases the absorbing capacity and easy for the backwashing. Then this water will passed to solid layer of activated Carbon here the rating of this layer is 5 micron so here all the colour , odor and other chemical impurities will be absorbed.

An arch-roller tracker is one of the solutions for the above problem and have high commercial value.  A arch- roller tracker system is a mechanism that isolate the tracking and load bearing to handle heavy solar collector.  Isolation of tracker drive unit independent of load bearing/load carrying function. ","The solar trackers are rising in popularity and solar panel tracking solutions are a more advanced technology for monitoring photovoltaic panels. However, they are not being used to its potential, even in solar power plants, due to drawbacks like low load bearing capacity of the existing system design. The tracker system are also least used in rooftop mounting of solar panels. Similarly, the solar tracker usage is very little in commercial solar drying solutions. The dryer or other collector are usually heavy, bulky and large in size. Henceforth its difficult to adopt the existing tracker system for these applications. The heavy and large size system need a tracker that separate the load from the collector and transfer directly to the grounding structure. This will free the tracker drive system from heavy load traction.  This will ease the operation and control of the tracker. A arch-roller tracker is one of the solution for the above problem and have high commercial value.  The objectives are    To design a system that tracks the sunlight for solar panels and increase efficiency and accuracy than other solar tracking system.   To design a commercially viable arch-roller type tracker system for heavy load commercial solar dryer and solar panels with an operational mode of fully automatic, semi-automatic and or manual. The arch-roller tracker mechanism is used to isolate the tracking and load bearing to handle heavy solar collector. ","The dual axis arch type solar tracker can be used in place of existing solar trackers in PV panel mountings. Apart from this, the arch-roller tracker is easily adoptable for rooftop PV panel mounting. 1310The potential application of arch-roller tracker are mounting of heat collector of solar dryer used in vegetable, fruits nuts and other many agriculture produce drying. the solar dryers are dominantly used for fish drying. This tracker will be easily adoptable for the industrial sector solar heaters and desalination plants.13101310So, the Solar Tracker found usage in Roof Top solar panel, Solar power plant, Agriculture solar dryers, solar fish dryers, solar heater, desalination plant and solar Agri-tillage vehicles.13101310The azimuth and tilt rotation of this dual axis arch-roller tracker will be useful in solar based agriculture locomotives used for tillage, watering, seed spreading and pesticide spraying need directional changes to cover the land area. the fixed support solar panels is very low efficient due to the frequent directional change. adoption of arch-roller tracker will come handy in this situation to improve the energy harvest and reduce the panel size.","The rooftop solar panel has no solution for tracking and the proposed arch-roller tracker has huge market in Roof Top solar panel installation. Agriculture solar dryers, solar fish dryers, solar heater, desalination plant and solar Agri-tillage, fertilizer, pesticide vehicles.

157,IDEAMH003746,Sunil Kulbhushan Sahuji,MAHARASHTRA,AURANGABAD,Device for atraumatic removal of dental crowns and bridges,"The proposed device is designed on the principle of long axis.’ In order to remove the said crowns and bridges atraumatically, the device works along the direction of paths of removal of the crowns and bridges which are exactly opposite to the direction of path of insertions of the said crowns and bridges.  The concept has been applied for Indian Patent (Patent No: 201921033764  Published- The Patent Office Journal No. 13/2021 Dated 26-03-2021), and The USA patent (application No: US17/762513 applied on 22-03-2022).   The Indian Patent Office and WIPO-PCT’s ‘written opinion of the international searching authority’ have accepted all the 17 claims made, under ‘Novelty’ and ‘Industrial applicability steps. For the step of patentability, the raised concerns (D1, D2) have been answered appropriately. ","At present, there are 2 methods of removing crowns and bridges:  1. By using crown removers (Goldfinch Dental Crown Remover, Waldent Automatic Spring loaded Crown Remover):  Till today, 90 of the instruments used in India as crown removers do not have any scientific principle of working. Most of the time they are unpredictable, prone to produce accidental injuries to the surrounding soft tissues and the underlying abutment teeth like fracture of the teeth, or even complete avultion of them. In spite of so many disadvantages, these instruments are still in use because they are cheaper and there is no any predictable, scientifically designed, dedicated device in the market.   2. By cutting the crowns and bridges:  When a clinician feels that the removal of crowns and bridges  by using the above mentioned crown removers is not possible or when they anticipate fracture or injury, most of the clinicians prefer to cut down the crowns and bridges through and through by using air rotors and diamond cutting burs to avoid fracture or other type of injuries. In these cases, the removed crowns and briges gets damaged totally and their reuse in the same patient after the retreatment of the said teeth is not possible and the clinician has to refabricate the crowns or bridges which is time consuming, expensive and unnecessarily increases the cost of the treatment to the patients.    ","Concept: Every tooth in the oral cavity is fixed in the alveolar bone of the maxillary and the mandibular jaws. An imaginary vertical line passing through the center of the tooth and the center of the tip of the root is called as the long axis of the tooth which makes a specific acute or obtuse angle with the horizontal and the vertical planes. While preparing a tooth for crowns and bridges, a clinician has to prepare the teeth by considering these long axes of the teeth. After making an impression of the prepared teeth, crowns and bridges are constructed in the dental laboratories and are to be inserted and cemented over the teeth in a specific path called as ‘path of insertion.’ So, if we want to remove these crowns and bridges from the teeth, they have to be removed by the application of controlled and balanced force exactly in the opposite direction called as ‘path of removal.’ If the force is applied in any other directions than their path of removal, it may result into fracture of the underlying natural teeth structures.    Objectives:  To remove the crowns and bridges smoothly, without damaging the underlying natural teeth structure, surrounding tissues and without causing pain or injury to the patient.  To remove the crowns and bridges in lesser time (few seconds to minutes) in order to save the working time.  ",This device is the primary and basic device required to be used in any retreatment cases. Every dental surgeon have to perform retreatments. So it will be requirement of every dental surgeon. This device will be used in all the dental colleges and in research and academic,"At present, more than 3 lakh dental surgeons are practicing in India.   We have more than 300 dental colleges with the intake capacity of more than 30000 students every year.  In coming 20 years time, the total number of practitioners in India may reach up to 6-7 lakhs.  This is a very huge market to cater.  Besides, this device being a patented idea, has enormous export potential which will contribute into Indias export and the vision of Make in India initiated by the Government of India.","1.

E,RAJASTHAN,JODHPUR,Developing Endoscope Socket to provide uninterpreted endoscopic visual field to ENT doctor for diagnosing patients with minimal discomfort.,"The Novelty of the proposed coating is developing a socket-based Anti-Fogging lens coating, which directly fits the existing scopes. The sterilizable socket-based Anti-Fogging solution will help perform more lengthy diagnostics procedures while reducing the cost burden on patients. The improved functionality with a coating of functional materials and Design Novelty of the socket will enable the product to be patented.Relevant Patent to proposed solution  JP2008006228, Anti-Fogging Socket for Endoscope, Jichi Medical Univ.

CN111077600, Lens Glass, Endoscope and Treatment Method of Lens Glass, Chongqing ","Innovations like optic fibers, wide-angle camera lenses, navigation assistance, and other technology are developed to enhance these scopes functionality. Yet, several unaddressed problems deteriorate the picture quality, like endoscope angle, inefficient cleaning, lens soiling, and fogging. The compromised picture quality increases the chances of error, thus reducing the diagnostics efficacy. The common problem that drastically affects the scopes visual quality is lens fogging.1310The products and services available in the market provide an Anti-Fog effect are surfactant-based repelling water molecules by forming a low-energy surface on the lens. The surfactant-based solution will produce a temporary effect, inefficient in performing lengthy procedures and degrades the quality of the scopes over time. The problem can be effectively addressed by developing a permanent Anti-Fogging coating, which will form a thin water molecule on the surface, providing a transparent film under fogging maintaining the visual quality. This will aid the doctors in performing the diagnosis without intervention resulting in better patient comfort. The uniqueness of the proposed coating is developing a socket-based Anti-Fogging lens coating, which directly fits on the existing scopes. The socket is transparent, biocompatible and sterilizable to help perform more lengthy diagnostics procedures with less cost burden to patients. ","Lens fogging occurs due to the temperature imbalance between the front lens and the airway cavity. The problem is severe in the case of ENT diagnosis, as more effort and time are required to reach the designated location. If the lens gets fogged in the middle of a procedure, the doctor has no other option than to remove the endoscope from the patient and start again. This dramatically increases patient discomfort and work fatigue of doctors. 1310Solution1310The proposed Polymer based coating will reduce water molecules surface tension and force them to spread into a thin film. The scopes will maintain the visual quality as the light can pass through these thin films with minimal distortion. The Anti-fogging test is evaluated in a lab setup under various temperature and humidity conditions to understand its performance. The socket based product will be subjected to mechanical damage tolerance and autoclave sterilization cycles for reusability. 1310Objectives 13101.9Achieving a minimum of 95 of initial glass Transparency with coating.13102.9Retaining Anti-Fogging effect for minimum of 10 minutes.13103.9Producing a glass socket for placing the Anti-fogging glass on the endoscope.13104.9Imparting re-usability with a minimum of ten procedures under autoclave sterilization.","Rural India accounts for 70 of the total Indian Population amidst the economic development and population influx to urban areas.

169,IDEAKR003891,Ganesh Venkatraman Bhat,KARNATAKA,UTTAR KANNAD,Novel Bio-Process Development for the Isolation of Biomolecules from the unexplored Arecanut Wash Liquid,"The innovation of the project lies in the process. However, HPLC and Preparative chromatography techniques have been well known. But these techniques have never been developed for the unexplored novel raw material AWL. We have developed the HPLC method and We have employed different separation techniques in a non obvious way. Various membranes, resins which others have not used elsewhere for such applications have been tested and employed. Also, the developed process is novel and have not been used elsewhere. We have filed the complete specification patent for the developed process. ","Most of the Indian companies such as Food  Beverages, Cosmetics, Nutraceuticals, Pharmaceuticals, etc., intend to manufacture a variety of their products using intermediate molecules such as EGCG, Catechins, etc., have been importing them from various Chinese and other Countries. These companies isolate such molecules from a cheap raw material using harsh chemicals that not only depict a low-grade purity product but also introduces carcinogens from the solvents used to isolate them, which is both detrimental to human health and also to the environment. Along with this, Indian companies are bound to pay the import duties while importing them from other countries which will add more cost to the industries which use them in the manufacturing line.1310Green tea or Acacia Catechu are not the only sources that are abundant in EGCG catechins. We have Arecanut as an alternate source that can be explored for the isolation of such molecules. 1310Fortunately, we have identified the areca nut wash liquid(AWL) which was unexplored until we did. AWL is obtained through boiling the areca nuts in water, a traditional method followed by the farmers from centuries old. 1310The presence of the molecules has been confirmed by simple preliminary phytochemical analysis and also by analytical HPLC. The amount of these molecules present in the raw material is abundant and this has helped us to develop a novel chromatographic separation and purification of molecules which can be completely scalable t","We add value to the AWL by applying in-house developed bioseparation processes. We employ downstream separation techniques such as Cross Flow Filtration and Chromatographic techniques to purify the antioxidant molecules according to the industry standards. 1310The raw material, i.e. Arecanut Wash Liquid contains a mixture of molecules ranging from Polyphenols, Sugars, Proteins, Alkaloids, Tannins, Minerals, micro and macronutrients. 1310By the application of the above-mentioned separation techniques, we are able to selectively purify the polyphenols from the raw material with a purity ranging from 80-98. 1310Also, with the application of in-house developed Ion exchange chromatography we are able to separate Arecoline, alkaloid found exclusively in areca nut. This alkaloid is a central nervous system stimulant and has potential application in the treatment of CNS-related disorders.1310","Our customer segment is mainly composed of industries. Industries such as Food  Beverages, Nutraceuticals, Cosmetics, Pharmaceuticals, Dye Intermediaries, etc., make use of these antioxidant molecules in the manufacturing of their final products. 1310The application of these antioxidants in the above-mentioned industries is because of the properties they exhibit such as preservatives, anti-obesity, anti-hypertensive, anti-aging, skin brightening, etc.1310But the market is mainly concentrated with the distributor chain for these molecules. Our main target is the distributors for marketing our products through the B2B channel.1310The Total addressable Market (TAM) globally is around 160 millions. The Serviceable Addressable Market is estimated to be 80-100 million considering we cater the APAC region out of which 20 million is concentrated in India. The Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) is 5-7 millions.1310India alone consumes around 1000 Tons of Catechin and 600 tons of EGCG. There is always a demand of Arecoline in the US and European market. Hence, our statistics are defendable and achievable as there are no producers of these molecules in higher purities such as 85 and above.1310","The major competitors being the Chinese companies. To name some of the Chinese companies that manufacture EGCG polyphenols in bulk are Hunan Sunfull, Novanat, Taiyo Green Power, Chengdu Wagott, Hunan Nutramax, etc. Some of the Indian companies those import these molecules on a large scale are: Unicorn Natural Products, Sami Labs, Phytotech extracts, Green Chem, Natural Remedies, Givaudan, Dynadis Biotech India etc. These companies import the low purity antioxidants and they use solvent-based extraction to isolate/purify the antioxidants.13101310The competitive advantage being, we are able to purify the antioxidants from a rich source that is natively available and in large quantity which helps us not to depend solely on green tea for the extraction of EGCG polyphenols. We employ chromatography-based separation which is highly selective and yields us better purity compounds that not only eliminate the use of harsh solvents but are also cost-effective.

Other than this no outsourced patent material or process will be used for the product development.","Wound management requires specific external factors along with proper dressing material for proper healing of wound bed. The innovation in this project relies on the development of a hydrogel sheet containing cell-laden allogenic Mesenchymal Stem Cells to promote active wound healing and wound closure in traumatic wound. Hydrogel provides a moist environment around the wound site which is ideal for extensive healing for both exudating and necrotic wounds.  The role of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in wound healing has a promising outcome and has been researched extensively in the last few decades. Moreover, allogeneic-MSCs have been shown to evade immune rejection by the host as they express very low levels of MHC class I, no MHC class II and do not induce activation of allogeneic lymphocytes. It also has greater regenerative and wound closure properties than other skin cell types like fibroblast and keratinocyte by inducing re-epithelization and angiogenesis. 1310Biological wound coverage materials contain cells like fibroblast and keratinocytes embedded in scaffolds trigger immune reaction. Our, proposition to establish wound coverage with hydrogel-laden allogenic MSCs that would provide a breakthrough in the treatment and management of traumatic and deep wounds. The value that we propose are development indigenous cell-laden wound dressing product to replace acellular dressing faster healing time a perfect replacement model for autografts/skin-flaps.","An ideal wound coverage should provide a moist, clean, environment, provide hydration, protect from infection, and additionally provide wound healing and tissue regeneration.  Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) possess the ability to differentiate into definitive cell types such as keratinocyte and fibroblasts and exhibit cell migration, angiogenesis, promote epithelialization, and granulation tissue formation, altogether resulting in accelerated wound closure. They are hypoimmunogenic as they do not express class I and II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and co-stimulatory proteins (e.g., CD40, CD80, CD86).  Therefore, transplantation of allogeneic MSC has a low risk of immune rejection. The use of hydrogel to deliver MSCs into the wound area and its regenerative properties are exciting and highly promising new areas of research. This modality may even be a precursor for treatment of regeneration of other tissue types such as bone and cartilage.  In our project, we will focus on developing a wound dressing with allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell-laden biocompatible hydrogel that has the potential to incorporate onto the body and accelerate and optimize healing and even potentially become a substitute for autologous skin grafts. Our first objective will be proceeded with in-vivo rat study with isolation of rat MSCs incorporated in hydrogel and then further move forward towards clinical trials with isolation of Human MSCs.","The Indian wound care management market is expected to rise at a steady growth of 6.2 CAGR from the period 2021 8211 2027.  In India, around 7 million people suffer from burn injuries each year with 1.4 lakh deaths and 2.4 lakh people suffering from a disability. Over 10 lakh people are moderately or severely burnt every year. This requires the regeneration of the whole skin structure, multi-layers with each having specialized cells, appendages, and other components. Current skin substitute includes standard surgical therapies such as flap coverage and surgical debridement removal of unhealthy tissue from a wound to promote partial healing depending on the type and extent of the burn. A large burnt area or with a severe degree of damage, it is hard to restore the entire skin integrity or it takes a long time to recover the entire skin. Skin transplantation could be another method to treat burn patients, but waiting for the perfect skin match of the donor and the recipient takes a very long time. Hence there is a need to develop an alternative technique to replace the traditional skin substitute. 1310Allogenic MSC-laden hydrogel dressing can accelerate the wound healing procedure and has a promising effect on tissue repair and regenerative properties. This helps in providing a cover of the wound bed from external infection, a moist environment for wound healing, and a re-epithelialization process accelerated by MSCs.","The advanced wound care management market of India is estimated to be valued at US 227.2 million in 2020 and is expected to exhibit a CAGR of 5.5 during the forecast period (2020-2027). With up to 1 - 2 lakh people succumbing to death and disability due to lack of wound management there is a proper need for wound care products that are cheap and easily available to the customers. The imported advanced wound dressing products are high in cost and certainly lack cellular complexity. In the current scenario, around 100 to 150 skin clinics and major hospitals are actively participating in wound management with more than 10 lakhs people requiring adequate dressing for wound healing. If we are able to provide our wound dressing solution to 10 percent of the active wound management market our total market size will be estimated at around 10 - 15 crore rupees in revenue per year. With the growing wound management market, we can grow further within the next 5 to 10 years to 100 crore revenue providing effective wound management solutions to a major share of skin clinics and hospitals.","1.

183,IDEATN004073,M Kanagasabapathy,TAMIL NADU,VIRUDHUNAGAR,COST EFFECTIVE FABRICATION OF HYBRID CAPATTERY WITH HIGH ENERGY DENSITY AND POWER DENSITY AS AN ENERGY STORAGE DEVICE,"No.  The primary objective of this idea is to design a capattery (having a combination of electrodes of supercapacitor and a high energy density battery) at commercial perspective as a viable alternate to Lithium ion and Lead acid batteries.   Fabrication of anodic and cathodic electrode materials for this asymmetric hybrid capattery is based on mixed multi-transition metal oxyhydroxides / sulfides composites impregnated from nano-structured carbon materials with a specific capacitance of 2000 F/g. Syntheses of electrode materials are carried out through viable and cost-effective electrochemical approach and can be carried out at room temperature using water-based electrolytes.  Designing of this asymmetric hybrid capattery is based on both Faradaic as well as electrical double layer charge-transfer technique and hence this capattery is having high specific energy and specific power and can be viable alternate to secondary batteries. Electrolytes as well as dielectrics will be chosen to fine-tune the specific capacitance and potential window (specifically on discharging after galvanostatic charging).   Importantly, charging-discharging life cycle is more than 10,000 times with  90  retention. Entire fabrication process does not involve hazardous materials and methodologies and also does not require high-tech or costlier machineries. Hence, this fabrication process can be extended to real-time industrial scale manufacturing for commercial perspective.","The primary aim of this project is to design industrially viable and cost-effective fabrication of a hybrid capattery with high specific energy and capacitance as an electrical energy storage device via green technologies.1310Though supercapacitors are known for higher specific capacitance with specific power, still lacking in specific energy with reference to Lithium-based batteries. And Lithium-based batteries are having high specific energy but has lower specific power. 1310As of date, lithium-based batteries are lacking to meet the high-power requirements for real-time applications such as electric vehicles. 1310Moreover, batteries are having a lower number of cycles (3500 times), whereas this capattery will have a higher number of cycles ( 10000 times).1310So this proposal is to develop a hybrid capattery device which is a combination of high power density supercapacitor and high energy density battery with enhanced lifetime (higher number of charging-discharging cycles). 1310Most importantly, the fabrication of electrode material is relatively cheaper, viable and can be extended to industrial-scale production for real-time applications.1310Arduino Uno interfaced, proto-type hybrid supercapacitor will be designed and will be deployed for real-time applications as an energy storage device.","The primary objective is to fabricate low-cost as well as viable electrode materials and electrolytes to enhance the specific power as well as specific energy of the existing batteries and supercaps. 1310In the first phase of trial studies, we achieved a specific capacitance of about 2800 F/g. This will be fine-tuned with reference to the composition of the electrode material and electrolyte.1310Nanocarbon-derived mixed transition metal oxides (FeO, NiO, ZnO, CoO, RuO, MnO2) films will be fabricated at room temperature via galvanostatic method. Rare earth metal oxides such as Ceria will also be incorporated. 1310Similarly conducting polymers such as substituted PANI will be synthesized electrochemically and will be used as electrolytes. To achieve higher potential and power density, specific polymer electrolytes will be used. Nanocarbon materials such as MWCNT and rGO will be co-deposited to enhance the surface area and to retard the specific resistance.1310It must be emphasized that fabrication of both electrode materials, as well as electrolytes, are carried out by green approach and at room temperature only. 1310By fine-tuning the composition of the electrode materials and electrolytes, specific power, as well as energy and reversible cycles, can be enhanced.1310 9Mathematical modelling and numerical simulations will be carried out to optimize bath parameters, crystal structure data as well as specific capacitance and specific energy of the film in various electrolytes.","1.9Can be deployed in real-time applications as a cost-efficient electrical energy storage device such as smartphone batteries, automobile batteries etc.13102.9Can replace batteries, since capatteries are having desired energy density. As a result, the unit cost for energy storage will be reduced. 13103.9Can be deployed in applications that require high specific power such as electric vehicles, portable heavy machinery.13104.9Since capatteries are having relatively higher life-time (higher number of charging-discharging cycles) than batteries, net operating cost (expenditure for replacement) will be reduced. 13105.9They can be quickly recharged, unlike batteries. 13106.9Can be used to harvest solar energy.13107.9Dependency of fossil fuels will be reduced if deployed in automobiles and vehicles. 13108.9Can be deployed in Uninterrupted Power Supplies and medical instruments.1310","As of date, batteries are having more than 99 percent market share under electrical energy storage devices. 1310Still, supercapacitors are not effectively deployed for real-time applications such as in smartphones, vehicles as well as in uninterrupted power supply systems. 1310But batteries are lacking a lower lifetime and power density and they require relatively higher maintenance than capatteries. 1310If a capattery with high specific power is developed, then it has the highest market potential and can replace batteries. This proposal aims to fabricate such a capattery with higher specific energy as well as specific power. By fine-tuning electrode materials as well as electrolytes, it is possible to design a capattery with a higher specific capacitance that can replace batteries. 1310Currently, a proto-type model is fabricated with the assistance of Energe Capacitors Ltd, Rajapalayam 626117, Tamilnadu.",Dr. M Kanagasabapathy  Assistant Professor   Department of Chemistry  Rajapalayam Rajus’ College  Rajapalayam 626117  Tamil Nadu,41 years of experience in teaching and research with 24 paper publications,Email: rrcmksgmail.com              Mobile: +91 9443862183,"Multiwalled nano carbon tube / reduced Graphene oxide embedded ternary and quaternary mixed transition metal oxide / sulphide composites based electrodes were fabricated.    At present, optimisation of composition of the electrode materials, electrolytes and conducting polymers as well as selection of better dielectrics towards the enhanced specific capacitance and specific energy are under investigation. Real-time deployment for back-up applications will be carried out.","Asymmetric electrodes for this hybrid capattery were fabricated at room temperature from aqueous baths. But by trial-and-error strategy, specific capacitance can be enhanced. It can be achieved from the available choices of the electrolytes, conducting polymeric materials, nanocarbon composites etc. To achieve the desired specific capacitance of 2000 F/g and specific energy of 100 to 150 W.h/kg., it requires  12 months.

But the problem is due to hammering the nails, the holes and crack formation occurs in the wall has to be considered as defects in the existing pipe clamping methodology. And also these defects shows its effects during rainy season like the water is leaking into the room through the hole and cracks present in the wall. To overcome these problems and to make the clamping easier we have designed the clamp with snap fit and adhesive technology. In this project we have designed the clamp in two parts i.e., Male part and female part. Male part consists of prongs for the snap fit and female part consist of adhesive. This clamp can be detach if there is any repair works in the pipe lines and without any damage the clamp has been attached to the same place where the pipelines are mounted. We have selected Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) material to make the product because ABS possesses better flexural strength (752.85Kg/cm2).

Although cleaning of solar panel has been a defining challenge for researchers mainly for balancing the cost with performance and durability, continuous efforts in this direction seem to be a positive step towards enhancing the efficiency of the devices. Dust is a fine, dry powder comprising miniature units of earth or waste material. Dust settlement for the most part depends on many no. of components such as size, weight, shape, site, tilt point surface completion, compound properties, stickiness, wind speed, etc. There are several challenges and benefits related to the cleaning techniques and involved labor cost and equipment . All the techniques are mainly focused on reducing the adhesion bond between dust particles and the panel by controlling electrostatic repulsion. The equipment needed is quite expensive in these methods and most of the techniques are installed separately on each solar panel. Therefore we need to design and develop a sustainable system that uses non-contact, continuous techniques which require little or no labor for cleaning.","Solar photovoltaic (SPV) plants are symbols of clean energy generation. In order to achieve the optimum efficiency as well as the calculated service life of the plant, the solar panels have to be clean. Cleaning can be achieved by various manual processes, but they seem to be energy-intensive and time-consuming efforts. Automatic robotic system has been successfully employed, but the additional maintenance and energy consumption always remain a point of debate for commercial applications.  Thats why a drone-based setup is now being developed for cleaning of the solar photovoltaic plants and also utilize for the faming. This approach of cleaning solar plates is quite environmentally friendly and this process is free from noise or any kind of air pollution.   The new system uses a drone to fully automate the process. The drone is kept inside a weatherproof dock nearby the solar panels, from which it is periodically released to perform cleaning.

The undertaking notion is initiated because of the cutting-edge problems which might be being confronted by a few everyday human beings each day, i.e., to find a vacant parking spot.. As its been acknowledged that 20 of the drivers have become indignant via means of riding the complete block to search for a vacant spot to park the car. In the present, a Real time parking guidance system is being developed with defined architecture using communication protocols and a software solution. ","Concerns around parking are becoming more pressing in order to better serve the city center. Recent advancements in meeting the globally linked spectrum could change these recurrent parking challenges into new opportunities. This Idea starts with detection of parking spaces that are free and occupied using Computer vision and numpy. The parking lot data is sent to a cloud server and reports the status of the parking lot through an online dashboard. The Software will take a coordinate file which will be generated from a snapshot of the image of the parking lot of video input.

The polling station is automated either it may be or at parament place or the same be put in a vehicle which is movable called mobile polling station. The polling station entry and exit is controlled by the automation process, where no manual intervention is required. The authenticity of voter is also done by using either Aadhar biometric or Aadhar IRIS input taken from the voter and processed, thus automated verification process is done without agent and polling officer presence. The principles shows that the entire process is automated at the level of polling station where voter exercise his/her vote without fear which leads to fair election process. In this process the voter id card is not required, which is a tedious process of inclusions and deletions regularly for every election. The extension of the above automated process, we need to connect the polling stations permanent and mobile both to the servers from where we are controlling the polling stations. The servers are at two layers, at first layer the constituency wise polling stations are connected to the local servers and at second layer all the local servers are connected to the central election commission server. ","The proposed automated Aadhar based online voting system provides people to vote in a secure manner without any fear. The online voting system also provides the security to the voter8217s by storing the vote in a secure digital form, if the voter votes against malevolent candidate. This system also guarantees not to leak the vote in front of anybody.1310It is hard to make the voting system trustworthy only because it has high security requirements: confidentiality and integrity. Confidentiality means all voters get assured about the privacy of votes and prevent selling of votes. Integrity means the assurance of election results and the votes are counted correctly. The election voting process have the following steps. They are 1310a) Enrolment of Voters1310b) Polling stations identification, 1310c) Nominations filing, verification, withdrawal and finalize the list of candidates who are contesting1310d) Voting Process organizing1310e) Counting process organizing and declaration of results.1310The alternative infrastructure is mobile polling stations (MPS) with have the same infrastructure like physical polling station, with good communication network and bandwidth. This MPS are used in places where network connectivity is poor, a smaller number of voters, extremists8217 potential areas. The MPS are with armed forces security, who can work round the clock in different time slots.1310",This proposal will be useful to the government of India and state governments to conduct the elections with less cost transparently. This product will save the spirit of democracy by electing right persons in free and fair manner without any fear about criminal natured politicians. The same application may be used for accurate survey purpose by any organization with customized modifications. ,"The polling station may accommodate for maximum of 1000 voters to cast their vote. The cost incurred for organizing one day polling operation is as follows:1310The staff required are Presiding officer, Assistant presiding officers, four Polling officers. The additional remuneration towards DA and TA for them is approximately Rs.10000/- per day for organizing one day polling.1310The proposed method requires only two employees for organizing the same polling event. In addition that the voters transportation cost will also be drastically, because as per the statistics 5 of voters are residing outside of their native place for their livelihood survival. 1310In addition to the cost effectiveness this method eliminates the duplicate voting and can get accurate list of voters list at any time instantly which saves the cost of voter enrolment also.1310",Dr K Venkateswara Rao,25 Years   PhD,9866003132,At present the central Election Commission using Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) for organizing the elections.

205,IDEATN004418,Ashokkumar Mariarathinam,TAMIL NADU,VIRUDHUNAGAR,Portable Rotary Fluidized bed Heat Pump Dryer for Herbal Leaves,"The idea not involves use of existing intellectual property.   The innovation in this proposed work, the integrated dryer is a combination of three innovative concepts such as Rotary chamber and fluidized bed and capability to operate at less than atmospheric pressure. The heat pump dryers available in the market to dry the herbal leaves are larger in size and not portable and are costlier. The proposed dryer overcomes the above said drawbacks. Based on the survey on contemporary dryers available in the market for drying leaves, It is inferred that a dryer with above mentioned combination of rotary chamber, fluidized bed and operating capability at lower pressure is not available. The proposed innovation is not granted as intellectual property rights worldwide.  As a part of this proposal, it is planned to apply for intellectual property rights as per the direction of Ministry of Micro, Small  Medium Enterprises (MSME) from the Indian patent office after successful completion of fabrication.","The conventional heat pump dryers available in the market are very large in size, process control by the user is limited and there in no vertical axis rotary type drying chamber. The proposed heat pump dryer is portable, compact and have rotary fluidized bed drying chamber. The main uniqueness of this dryer is the availability of provisions for controlling the process parameters. 1310The following are the uniqueness of the innovation of the proposal:13101. The vertical axis rotary drying chamber13102. Provisions for controlling the process parameters13103. Portable and compact13104. Reduced power consumption in comparison to conventional dryers13105. Fluidized bed drying chamber1310","The working fluid (air) is force to flow through the rotary drying chamber, hence the mode of mass transfer is observed to be convective mass transfer. As per the Newton8217s law of cooling analogy for convective mass transfer phenomenon the concentration difference is the driving force for the mass transfer, so the concentration difference in moisture between the dry air and herbal leaves will leads to transfer of water vapour from the herbal leaves to the dry air and the drying is achieved.  1310The herbal leaves are loaded into the rotary fluidized bed drying chamber which rotates about the vertical axis to impart centrifugal force to the leaves. The moisture content in the leaves is expelled towards the circumference of the drying chamber and gets dripped to the water collecting tank. 1310The herbal leaves after subjected to rotation is deposited at the bottom of the chamber and then it is dried by dry air which is heated by heat pump. During this secondary drying process drying chamber is periodically rotated in the opposite direction about its vertical axis for increasing the surface area of contact between the air and leaves. The secondary drying process is repeated till the desired percentage reduction in weight of leaves is achieved.1310","Drying of herbal leaves has become mandatory for farmers involved in cultivation of herbal leaves for adding value to the product. Siddha and Ayurveda industries required dryers for drying herbal leaves to facilitate powdering process and preserve it for long period of time. 1310The portable heat pump dryer is available in the market for drying the cloths alone. Hence a dryer customized for formers, Siddha and Ayurveda industries will benefit them immensely.  1310The main disadvantage in the contemporary heat pump dryers are as follows:13101.9Larger in size 13102.9Cost of the dryer is high13103.9Less portability13104.9No integrated drying chamber.1310The proposed herbal leaves dryer mitigates the above disadvantages of the contemporary heat pump dryer, so there is a bright opportunity for this heat pump dryer. 13109The farmers in and around the Virudhunagar district are facing many problems in drying and also the methods followed by them are highly consuming electricity. These specific problems were brought to us by the herbal leaves cultivators and Siddha medicine manufactures in Virudhunagar district.   During the brief discussion with them we understood that there is an high demand for this type of dryer in Tamilnadu and also all over in India. So the market opportunities are very large once the proposed model is successfully completed. 1310 Target Market131082269Small scale formers cultivating herbal leaves131082269Siddha industries 131082269Ayurveda medicinal industries","Our team decided to work on Herbal leaves drying after an interaction with farmers involved in herbal plants cultivation. Two farmers from Aruppukottai involved in cultivation of Moringa trees was introduced by the proprietor of Tamilnadu Council for Enterprise Development (TACED) and explained to us about the problems encountered by them in drying. After several trials with non- scientific methods the farmer encouraged us to find a solution to this problem as it will benefit the society a lot. Further, the farmers highlighted the loss of nutrients issue in contemporary drying methods and endorsed us to develop a dryer which minimise the nutrient losses. 13109A heat pump dryer was designed fabricated and experimental investigation was performed on five different types of herbal leaves like Tulsi, Bermuda grass, Curry leaves etc. In this proposal, it is planned to combine the heat pump dryer with a rotary drying chamber for drying.  The experience in working with heat pump dryer is helpful in design and developing the product for this proposal. An experimental investigation has to be performed on the product after the fabrication process to validate our drying process for preservation of nutrients. 13109The product will be of great use to farmers trying to add value to their product and to the siddha and Ayurveda medicine manufacturers.

These systems have been used in different sectors such as agriculture, police department, and medical assistance. The functionality of these systems is application specific. Therefore, it is not possible to use a drone developed for specific application in another application without modification. 1310Currently, the police department uses UAS to collect information during protests and also to collect evidences after crimes. Therefore, there is need to develop a fully autonomous system that can collect real-time evidences from the crime site in absence of police or from areas which is difficult to reach by police on time. Thus, the proposed system can help police department in the collection of evidences before destroying or alter by accused person from crime spot.1310Therefore, we propose to introduce a new system that will have following functionalities:131082269Fully autonomous131082269Always in read to fly mode131082269Collect evidences from crime spot131082269Identify accused and victim 1310","The UAS have been playing a significant role in crime scene investigation and faster accident reconstruction. It will help in investigation to gets fine details about accidental area and vehicles. However, this concept is used after happening of accident or crime. Therefore, there is chance of destroying or altering evidences from crime site by the accused person. 1310The objective of this proposal is to develop an UAS to collect evidences from crime site in proximity to real-time. It wills fully autonomous system, therefore it will always in ready to fly condition. This system involves following functionalities such as calculation shortest path, identification of crime site, and automatically acquisition of data. This system consists of three additional parts are i) Ground Control Station (GCS), ii) Mobile App and iii) Smart band as shown in Figure 1. Smart band will consist of GNSS system and communication unit. Whenever, anyone is required help at that movement, it starts communication with nearby GCS. Smart band will send geolocation of victim to the GCS. Afterword, GCS released instructions to UAS. The GCS will consist of a computer along with communication device through that UAS can be monitor remotely. Also, the acquired data by UAS can be collected in real-time at GCS and nearby police our a mobile App. Apart from these, one extra feature we are going to add that is identification of accused persons. This will save time of investigation team.1310","The proposed system is having immense potential to stop crime. It will to help police department in collection of evidences, and identification of accused person. Furthermore, it can be used during protest time to monitor the protestor. In near future, the proposed system can be integrated with security system. It is capable to acquire geospatial data, therefore it can be used in surveying and mapping. It can be used to deliver emergency medicines at accidental spot.","India has huge population, henceforth everyday thousands of crime has been reported at police station. But, due to lack of evidences many criminals are not getting punishment. Therefore, UAS system with capabilities of evidences collection can help to police department.

Leather has been used extensively in a range of products, especially in the fashion industry. But over the years, people have realised the harm caused to animals to produce that leather tote you love or those boots on your wish list. With many shunning the material for ethical reasons, the urgency of finding an alternative presented the use of coconut water. The coconut water obtained during the coconut fruit processing is being wasted most of the time. The coconut water has good cellulose concentration. Processing of coconut water, fermentation to obtain the cellulose jelly and remoulding to required shape are the main stages involved in the process of leather producing. ","The collection of matured coconut water that is rich in cellulose and fermenting it to yield good quality of cellulose fibre. The pleather is biodegradable and compostable.

Various types of water filters have been manufactured for many years, however, their availability and accessibility to every household is still a problem of concern. Especially for the people living in rural areas, there is a lack of water filtration devices usually because of their high cost and set-up procedures. This obviously excludes the less privileged from basic amenities and moreover, the increase in urbanization is making the natural water bodies polluted and unfit for drinking purposes. Designing of low-cost hydrogel-based water filter will make it easily accessible to both rural as well as urban areas. The proposed project will definitely benefit society on large scale. The reusability, cost-effectiveness, high absorptivity, ability to remove chemical contaminants, and bacterial contaminants through silver nanoparticles of hydrogels make it an ideal material for the manufacturing of a filtering device. To date, no such device has been made using this method as cited in the literature above and this work will therefore stands as novel and highly efficient.","Objectives of the project:131082269To design a potential water filter from natural gum (Moringa Oleifera gum) based cost effective superabsorbent for water purification to meet the need of rural India.131082269To decorate the designed superabsorbent with silver nanoparticles for destroying the bacterial contaminants.131082269To characterize the synthesized hydrogel samples by using FTIR, H1 8211NMR, UV-Visible spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, TEM.131082269To validate the results through adsorption kinetics131082269To test the purity of water after filtration through different parameters like TDS, conductivity, alkalinity, pH, Acidity, Sulphates, chlorides, hardness.131082269To perform reusability studies of the developed filter131082269To study the biodegradation studies of used superabsorbent to check its degradation in burial soil and compost soil.131082269To perform cytotoxicity and MTT assay for proving its desirability for human consumption.131082269Final product testing as per Industrial standard.13101310","Water is the elixir of life and it is important for humanity not only for drinking but also for many other daily activities and therefore we can8217t sustain our life without it.

The solution consists of two parts one being the patient station which consists of a 7dof robotic configuration capable of executing all the motions necessary for performing ultrasound rocking, tilting, rotation and translation where our design offers a large workspace, therefore, offering capabilities to perform ultrasound on the lateral side as well. The motions performed by the doctor are exactly replicated through the robot in real-time. The ultrasound image is processed and transmitted to the radiologist8217s screen for diagnosis. Data being transmitted is encrypted to ensure maximum security. At the second part of our product, the doctor8217s station the radiologist sitting remotely performs the ultrasound on the patient. He controls the robotic arm using a paired control probe and joystick. Doctor gets the real-time position of the probe. There is audio-video communication from the patient for continuous feedback. Real-time ultrasound images are received and reported.","As per WHO, imaging is needed for diagnosis in 20-30 per cent of clinical cases and ultrasound and/or plain radiographs are sufficient for 80-90 per cent of those cases. Yet, two in three across the world lack access to medical imaging. Even in India 68.84 per cent of the population live in rural India and 80 per cent of the radiologists are in urban areas, this leads to a lack of access to medical imaging which makes people travel long distances for quality healthcare and miss an early diagnosis.

224,IDEATS004819,Varsha Yogesh Bhole,MAHARASHTRA,RAIGAD,AI/ML-based Fruit Quality Evaluation and Shelf-Life Prediction System through Contactless and Non-destructive Approach,"Yes, applicant has received patent for the technology proposed to be used in developing this idea.","Agropeeper Technologies provides a patented system for sorting and grading of the fruits using AI/ML techniques for early detection of internal defects without cutting the fruits as well as analyzing multiple significant maturity indices like color, ultra-structural changes in texture of the fruit to measure precisely the quality, shelf life, and optimum harvest time of the fruits. The basic purpose is the identification of the shelf-life of the fruits by using non-destructive and non-penetrative methods, thus helping the farmers, fruit distributors or warehouse dealers in extending or prolonging the remaining useful life of fruits. A specially designed incubator with a triggered regulator can time the ripening process as per the requirement and is beneficial for decision making for agriculture value chain actors. The major advantage of the design is the hand-held device with easy-to-use features and fast results. It is a lightweight with a robust framework for running the inference on mobile, as it imparts the results within a fraction of a second and also results in good generalization ability. Our design can be easily replicated and  deployed over multiple devices and can help large group of workers to finish the task of grading in no time. The work process of the warehouses and fruit storage units gets automatized. It can give a clear picture to the managers about the condition of fruits at their dashboards, avoids a lot of manual and paper work, thus saving money.","What we found: Currently, the quality of the fruits has been assessed manually by visual inspection of their physical characteristics like color, size, and external damages which is not useful to find the internal damages of the fruits as well as not beneficial to determine precise shelf-life of fruits. So, the major concern in the present system is finding the internal damages/contamination of the fruits non-destructively for identifying fruit’s shelf-life accurately. So, the biggest challenge is the reduction of post-harvest loss: currently, the country is incurring the post-harvest loss of Rs2 lakh crore per year (in 2020-21 according to CAGR) is being the post-harvest losses at the time of harvesting (i.e. at the farm level), at the time of transportation as well as during the storage, which is varying from 15 to 50 percent every year. So, there is a need to equip with smart solution.    Solution: In the solution, a method is disclosed that finds internal damages without destruction of fruits as well as analyzing multiple significant maturity indices like color, ultra-structural changes in texture of the fruit to precisely measure the shelf life, optimum harvest time of the fruits.    Objective of the project: Development of version_1 of s/w + H/W prototype","1. This application would be helpful to reduce the post-harvest losses at the farm level, during the storage, during the transportation for all food supply chain stakeholders (Farmers, wholesalers, warehouses, exporters, Retailers)  2. Useful in sorting and grading of produces","There are no such systems available to predict the optimum harvest time as well as evaluate the quality and estimate the shelf-life precisely by observing the internal characteristics without cutting the fruits. So that produces can be dispatched at distant places according to their life and hence better price. So, our system delivers a solution for multiple problems like Segregation while taking the produce from a farm, reducing transportation and storage costs.    Impact: Environmental value: Preserving the environment due to reduction in post-harvest losses/wastes   Social value: Contributing to the Doubling Farm Income strategy due to reduction in post-harvest losses/wastes  Economic value: Improves product quality, increases export efficiency thus ultimately increasing farmers economy. Considering the current agricultural practices the proposed system has huge market potential.    Market: current focus is on addressing post harvest loss (PHL) in mango. Avg per kg cost of mango is Rs 116.39, and est revenue/ha is possibly Rs 3,84, 087/- (3.3 MT/hac). If we consider the Ratnagiri region of Maharashtra, revenue generation suppose to be Rs 2259.667 Cr. But, due to PHL (12.74 percent), total revenue could be decreased by Rs 286.147 Crores and at farm level (Rs 240cr). Initially if we cover at least 0.1 percent of market (i.e. 16 big farmers) at farm level, we could increase the revenue by Rs 2,40,42,700/.

227,IDEAMH004871,GAWANDE YOGESH RAJENDRA,MAHARASHTRA,AURANGABAD,Soybean Reaper  Collector,Problem Statement 1:   Today various types’ harvesters available in the market but all these have some major drawbacks due to which farmers are unhappy  unwillingness to buy these harvesters. The main problem is regarding functionality and efficiency of the harvester.   The various problems identified are as follows.   1) Vibrations of Engine.   2) Jerk during cutting operation.   3) Engine Location.   4) Difficult to operate.   5) Wear  Tear or abrasion of cutting Blade.   6) Difficulties in transportation.   7) No provision for collection of harvested crops.   All these problems lead to   a) The wastage of soybean grains 80-100 kg per acre.   b) Less harvesting area per day.   c) Body pain to operator.   d) Excess transportation cost. ,Solution 1:   To overcome problem related to soybean harvesting we have developed a small 2 HP 50 cc 4 stroke engine based machine which can do two operations that is cutting  collecting of soybean crop. We have developed a compact gearbox for the engines having more than 5000 RPM. The main USP of this gearbox is there are two outputs with two different RPM  torque. Which helps to drive the wheels and also the drive the cutting blade and collecting mechanism.  Advantages:  1) As there is a small engine used there is very less vibrations and also less weight.  2) The product is designed in such a way that it can be easily attached to two wheeler for transportation from one place to another.  3) The machine can do two operations one is cutting  second is collection. This helps to reduce efforts required for collection  cutting.   4) It is women friendly as it is light weight and easy to operate.  5) Cutting Area coverage is almost 5 times more than a women labour per day.,"In Maharashtra, soybean is cultivated on an area of 3.8 M ha with production of 3.07 m ton with second rank in India. This shows the Soybean Harvester market Potential. This is great opportunity to capture the market by giving efficient  function able harvester to the farmers. About 95 per cent farmers reported that shortage of the labor during the peak period of demand unavailability of labor during sowing, intercultural operations, spraying, harvesting and threshing as major constraint in soybean production. Same number of farmers (95) reported high labor charges at time of peak operations like sowing, weeding and harvesting. As the labor requirement during the sowing, intercultural operations and harvesting of soybean is generally high due to glut of harvesting kharif crops at a time, availability of enough labor at reasonable wages is the major monetary aspect of soybean cultivation which directly helps in the earning economic benefits to farmer. This proves the need for the development of soybean harvester. A study was conducted in the 20 villages of five districts of western Maharashtra.

228,IDEATN004911,Sasikala Rajesh,TAMIL NADU,NAMAKKAL,A Novel Process for recycling Post-Consumer PLA (Poly Lactic Acid) Waste for Sustainable Production of Methyl Lactate by catalytic Methanolysis.,"No. The idea of the proposed work has been tried with various type of catalyst (which is the heart of the process) by researchers globally. The catalyst they developed for the process is a unique organo metallic complex to achieve better conversion, product selectivity and yield. Mild reaction conditions are also possible with this type of catalyst.","Bio bag manufacturing industries produce sizable volume of waste materials starting from Extrusion, printing and bag making process. These waste materials are classified as plain waste and printed waste. Accumulated PLA based waste materials are subjected to reprocessing. The reprocessing process involves grinding, melting and extruding to small particles suitable for mixing with virgin raw materials. In order to obtain desired physical properties of blown film, usage of reprocessed raw material (RP) is restricted to 0.5 to 1.0 wt/wt. Therefore it is not economical to reprocess all the PLA based waste materials to extrudate. Chemical recycling of PLA is an alternative to mechanical recycling and composting of postconsumer PLA, resulting in lower production costs and value-added products.1310Chemical recycling methods, including pyrolysis, hydrolysis, and acid-base depolymerization, have been demonstrated in the literature however, these processes are characterized by high temperatures (250°C). Milder operating conditions can be achieved by the catalyzed transesterification reaction of PLA to produce alkyl lactates, which are considered as green solvents because of their low toxicity and biodegradability. Alkyl lactates are considered as substitutes to oil-derived solvents with applications in polymer manufacturing, biochemicals, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals etc. ","Synthetic plastics are indispensable in our everyday life.  They are typically organic polymers of high molecular mass most commonly derived from petrochemicals. Usage of these non-degradable materials has increased many folds due to their broad functionality and low cost. Extensive usage and demand for these materials resulted in plastic pollution which is considered one of the world8217s largest environmental disasters. This led to the development of a novel class of plastics, referred to as bio-based plastics. Poly(lactic) acid (PLA) is the most frequently used member of this family. Due to the lack of a holistic recycling strategy, its large scale utilization can turn out to be an acute source of plastic pollution in the future.  Unlike other attempts of reprocessing, chemical recycling of PLA establishes an eco-friendly recycling concept aimed at the production of a valuable lactate ester through solvent assisted transesterification of PLA waste. The primary objective of this innovation optimize the degradation parameters of PLA based spent bio bags by methanolysis process catalyzed by metal complexes to produce a green solvent viz., methyl lactate which can be transformed back into PLA via lactide. 1310 The scope of this innovation  is not only limited to the selection of an appropriate system) but also extends to analyze the selectivity of the solvent towards the PLA fraction in a commingled stream of different PLA substrates on the yield of the lactate ester.","Rapid industrialization and increase in the application of methyl lactate in various end-use industries such as agriculture, cosmetics, and industrial application, etc. are the key factors that are boosting the growth of the methyl lactate market. Also, the growing demand for methyl lactate in is driving the growth of methyl lactate market. The rise in the usage of biobased and non-toxic methyl lactate by end-use industries is one of the latest trends that is fueling the growth of methyl lactate market. Therefore, the manufacturers in the methyl lactate market are more focused on high-quality product offering that will increase their customer base. The end users in the agricultural sector are using methyl lactate as a solvent in the agriculture field for enhanced crop protection. Therefore, the methyl lactate is creating opportunities for the pesticide manufacturers to offer innovative product offering an broaden their product portfolio in the continually evolving methyl lactate market. The application of methyl lactate in agrochemicals as a solvent is expected to grow in the coming years. Also, the rising demand for high-quality methyl lactate among end users is expected to drive the growth of the methyl lactate market globally.","The Asia Pacific region is expected to dominate the methyl lactate market followed by North America and Europe region. The methyl lactate market in the Asia Pacific is expected to witness higher growth rate as there is a massive presence of methyl lactate manufacturers in China and Japan.The Asia Pacific region is expected to grow significantly in the methyl lactate market due to the increasing demand for methyl lactate in agriculture and pharmaceutical sector. North America region is expected to grow rapidly as there is an increased application of methyl lactate in various end-use industries.

The existing products and adaptations include using tools like screwdrivers which farmers use to tear open the bark of the stem of the grape tree, spraying chemicals like kerosene and dichlorvos which are harmful for both plants and humans. Farmers also install traps at different locations to prevent infestation in their farms, however, they are ineffective and end up capturing beneficial insects as well. Moreover, all these solutions focus on the stage when the stem borer has already started infestation to the extent that the farmers are able to see visual cues indicating almost 60 percent of infestation in the tree.1310We propose to detect infection inside the tree before visual and physical cues are notable to human naked eyes. This would also eliminate the error of visual cues going unnoticed by human tracers. Therefore, our solution on the other hand uses a non-invasive and a non-destructive method of detection of stem borers inside the tree.","Stem borers are xylophagous insects that infect crops resulting in reduction of tree life, impacting quality and yield of the produce. They affect many crops however impact is more in cash crops which are commercially very important to farmers, hence we focused on grapes. Current adaptations are primitive, insufficient and end up causing further damage to the tree. These solutions are practiced when the borer has already caused damage to the farm. Therefore, late identification is the main issue which compounds the current problems.1310To bridge these gaps, we plan to help farmers with an end to end solution. We aim to build a high precision, portable, non-invasive scanning device that can be used to find the extent of damage caused due to infestation and the exact spot of the stem borer inside the plant before identification of any visual or physical cues by human experts. This will help farmers by making the process of detection non-speculative. The system comprises a human-machine interface using which the farmer would be able to visualise the infestation and location of borers. Our innovation lies in the unique identification of the problem, digital signal processing of the radar signal and leveraging machine learning for high precision detection of stem borers in field conditions and for noise reduction. We have built a preliminary prototype for data collection.","Apart from grape stem borer the problem is prevalent in almost all crops like coffee with 40 percent yield loss, mango with 40-50 percent yield loss, sugarcane with 33 percent yield loss, and many more. The solution we are developing can be used to detect not just stem borers, but also other pests like fruit borers.

232,IDEAKR004931,Vivek Ghate,KARNATAKA,DAKSHINA KANNADA,Localized Delivery of Cyclosporine-A to Cause Thickening o the Peri-Implant Mucosa during the Placement of Dental Implants,"The proposed idea aims to favorable utilization of the drawback of cyclosporine A in terms of causing gingival hyperplasia to increase the success of dental implants. The technology of developing a double layered patch with one sided drug release, is unique in the terms of application around the implant, protection of drug from washing off into the saliva, and exertion of the local action. Moreover, the formulation reduces the overall dose of drug required to induce advantageous gingival hyperplasia. Though patches are attempted in the past of the treatment of dental and oral cavity disorders, no reports exist on the proposed technology for the augmentation of the peri-implant mucosa. The success of the project may result in a significant solution towards the conventional techniques such as grafting, and surgery for increasing the thickness of the peri-implant mucosa. In line with it, a draft of the work is submitted to the patent agent for a detailed prior art search and filing of the provisional patent. ","The novelty of the proposed product lies in the following areas:1310(1) The selection of the active agent: Cyclosporine-A is a commonly prescribed corticosteroid, which has a major side-effect of causing gingival hyperplasia. The effect is more pronounced during oral and systemic dosing.  The proposed solution utilizes the side-effect of the well-known drug as a way to solve the problem of dental implant rejection. 1310(2) Unmet need in dental healthcare: Dental implants are being used extensively to effectively treat the dental complications, and the success of the procedures remain at the expense of the proper thickness of the peri-implant mucosa. The reduction in the dose due to the bioadhesive nature of the product will overcome the potential risks of systemic dosing of cyclosporine-A. 1310(3) The unique and novel approach: The proposed solution of mucoadhesive patches as a platform for the delivery of cyclosporine-A enables a localized delivery of the drug to the peri-implant tissues, reduces the wastage of the drug via saliva, and thereby reducing its side-effects. 1310(4) Continence and self-application: The patch formulation enables the easy application onto the gingival tissues of the implant laden tooth socket, and can be administered without the help of a visit to the clinical setup. 1310","82269The current treatments for achieving peri-implant mucosal augmentation is surgery and grafting. These procedures are invasive and extremely skill-intensive processes and effect the patient and their quality of life. 131082269Our solution is the non-invasive and non-surgical use of cyclosporine-A in the form of a double layered dissolving mucoadhesive patch system. 131082269Cyclosporine-A is in clinical practice as an immunosuppresant. However, gingival hyperplasia has been reported as a major side-effect during long-term therapy with cyclosporine-A. 131082269Our invention uses thus aims at repurposing cyclosporine-A to use its inherent property of gingival hyperplasia, to cause peri-implant mucosal augmentation for effective placing of a dental implant. 131082269Furthermore, the phenytoin as an active agent is housed in a double layered dissolving mucoadhesive patch thereby reducing its systemic exposure, and action at the site-of-complication. 1310 1310The objectives of the study are - 1310(1) Formulation and characterization of the oral mucoadhesive patches containing cyclosporine-A 1310(2) Performance evaluation of the mucoadhesive patches, safety and toxicity evaluation 1310(3) Efficacy testing of the optimized formulation by comparing the thickness of the peri-implant mucosa before and after treatment in preclinical animals1310","The proposed solution falls under the category of dental healthcare and pharmaceutical interventions. The primary application of the product is in dental clinics and patients who have undergone placement of a dental implant, and those who have a thin peri-implant mucosa biotype. ","Dental implants to replace the missing teeth are gaining popularity all over the world. Long term success of the implant is strongly determined by the per-implant soft tissues integrity. Soft tissue thickness and contours are important diagnostic factors that influence the esthetic outcome of an implant restoration and also thin biotype may cause recession and bone loss around the implant which may lead to phonetic difficulties and food impaction. All these will lead to implant failure, and huge financial loss as well as mental and physical trauma to the patient. Thus the market potential for the product is large especially in India owing to the number of dental implants being used in the dental setup, and the affordability of the implant. ","• Dr. Veena K.

For these purposes, thermoelectric cooling machines can be an option because thermoelectric cooling machines are more compact, with no leakage problems, lighter, portable, easier to maintain, and more durable. These days society faces an energy crisis but also the harmful effects of pollution. Thermoelectricity is a 8220Green Technology8221 to generate electricity without any harmful effect. The educational institutions, furnace regions, metro cities, industrial areas, universities, and other locations can be selected for the establishment of such energy centers where the waste heat can be easily available and can be recycled after conversion to the same system. This system would be used for air ventilation in cars. This system is a boost for government policies like solar cities and solar cities as well. ","The performance of solar TE (Thermo Element) cooling systems can be enhanced by improving and optimizing the heat exchanger structure and the operating parameters because those aspects significantly affect the efficiency of the whole system.1310Moreover, the performance of a solar TE cooling system can be improved by selecting TE and PV (Photo Voltaic) systems with higher performances. The average ZT (Zero Tolerance) value of the TE module is only approximately 0.8 at present. If the ZT factor of the TE material could be further improved and increased to, for eg 2.0 the COP (Coefficient of Performance) value and energy saving of this TE cooling system would be further increased. The advances in TE material make it possible to significantly improve the ZT factor through nanotechnology. Two primary approaches are bulk samples containing nanoscale constitutes and low dimensional materials. New TE materials with larger ZT factor values intrigue breakthroughs in various applications.The main objective of this study is to design and build an affordable solar thermoelectric refrigerator for the people living in remote parts of our country where electricity is still not available."," The refrigerator could be used to store perishable items and facilitate the transportation of medications as well as a biological material that must be stored at low temperatures to maintain effectiveness. The design of the solar-powered refrigerator is based on the principles of a thermoelectric module (i.e., Peltier effect) to create a hot side and a cold side. The cold side of the thermoelectric module is utilized for refrigeration purposes to provide cooling to the refrigerator space. On the other hand, the heat from the hot side of the module is rejected to ambient surroundings by using heat sinks and fans. The designed solar thermoelectric refrigerator was experimentally tested for cooling purposes. The results indicated that the temperature of the refrigeration was reduced from 27 °C to 5 °C in approximately 44 min. The coefficient of performance of the refrigerator (COPR) was calculated and found to be about 0.16.1310i) Used in the Food industry1310ii) large kitchens to store food in the rural side.1310iii) Refrigerators are used where there is shortage of power, especially in automobiles and aircrafts.1310","Market to be focused on the remote areas and rural areas of the country. Whereas electricity supply is to less compared to urban and metropolitan areas. By selling it at a reasonable price where people can afford it, at the same time there should be a profit to the company. Most commercially available TE modules have a thermoelement length range from 1.0 · 10-3 m to 2.5 · 10-3 m. The new methodology to design the high-performance TE (Thermo Electric)cooling systems includes the following 2 main steps: use of the performance curve and the basic physical properties of a TE module measured from an accurate module test and use of nondimensional entropy flow equations to determine the TE cooling design parameters for the maximum COP of the TE cooling system.

This invention is a smart way to save fuel and optimize power generation.,"Whenever the demand increases the CT coil experiences more current and provides a higher analog signal to the IC, which leads to activate the servo actuators. Servo actuator is connected to the Gear control lever as well as engine throttle proportionally and pulls it. By pulling the throttle the engine RPM increases and simultaneously by pulling the gear lever, the gear ratio decreases proportionally. The combination of these two mechanisms results in unchanged RPM as output for the alternate with enhanced torque which is now needed in load condition. 1310When there is some drop in load, the CT coil induces lower voltage for the IC. After processing the input data IC gives the signal to the stepper motor this proportionally actuates (Releases). The moment of the actuator changes the gear ratio of CVT and releases the throttle valve simultaneously which results, lower RPM of the engine and magnification in the gear ratio simultaneously. The combination results again unchanged speed as output for alternator but with lower torque as there is no load. In this condition the engine runs at its idling speed and consumes minimum fuel. Other conditions may occur in between condition 1 and 2 and the combination of Throttle, CV Gear ratio and EM Synchronizer provides unchanged RPM for alternator with exactly required torque for 50 Hz and 220 V without any noticeable fluctuation.

243,IDEAKL005042,Rosemary Benny,KERALA,THRISSUR,Namaste - The NoWaste App,No,"At the Black Soldier Fly factory, the collected food waste is fed to the BSF larvae. These larvae decompose all the biowaste to grow. Afterwards, the BSF larvae, the frass ( BSF larvae excreta) as well as the decomposed material is collected. Each of these products is very useful for people and will have a very high demand in the market. Also, Results show that direct CO2eq emissions are 47 times lesser than the emissions from composting. Regarding the overall GWP, the LCA shows that composting has double the GWP of the BSF treatment facility based on the functional unit of 1 ton of biowaste (wet weight). The BSF larvae are an extremely high source of protein since they convert around 90 of the food waste into proteins in their body. The larvae known to be extremely rich in protein can be successfully used as a substitute for animal feed at prices as low as half of the cost of currently available animal feed. The decomposed organic matter and frass can be used as manure for plants and crops. These larvae can be fed to pets such as reptiles and birds. The availability of these larvae and other products at any given time is not an issue since a single female fly can produce up to 500 eggs. Mass production can thus be achieved at very low costs. The collection and breeding of these flies can be achieved with as little effort as some light and a cage and the black soldier flies do not eat when fully grown. ","We solve the problem of the disposal of solid waste through our app and factory.1310The aim is to start a community for proper collection and relaying of waste from individual households through our app, and managing and disposing of them via methods beneficial to the environment and the society as a whole. We use a sustainable farming system to grow, hatch and raise black soldier fly larvae for pets like reptiles, chickens and small animals. We market our larvae products under the brand name Namaste. The cost of animal feed could be reduced to 50  by using BSF Treatment.1310Currently, fish feed costs ?60 per kg, but usage of BSF larvae as feed could reduce the cost to ?15 per kg, and even if we sell it at a cost of ?30 per kg it is profitable for both farmers and us.1310The quantity of feed needed would also drastically reduce since 5g of BSFL would compensate for 10g of the ordinary food feed.1310","Our app Namaste, about what it does and how the app works to provide a convenient platform for people to not only get rid of the household waste but also dispose of it in the most effective and eco-friendly way possible. The users are provided with the timings of waste pickup by the community volunteers in their particular locality. The volunteers have frequent collection trips throughout the week, the timings of which are decided beforehand and stored in the app to provide the users with a choice. The user can then select a date and time from the list to schedule their pickup. Apart from this option, the app also shows the nearby waste collection centres to the user in case the person wants to personally drop the waste off at a centre. One of our aims, a subtle one for that, is to empower women and women communities. We intend to include women organizations in the collection and transit process of the waste, thus empowering them.","The initial investment required for this solution is negligible. The procurement of BSF is not hard in places like Kerala since they are. abundantly found here. The raising and hatching are not a problem. The cost of animal feed could be reduced to 50  by using BSF Treatment.1310Currently, fish feed costs ?60 per kg, but usage of BSF larvae as feed could reduce the cost to ?15 per kg, and even if we sell it at a cost of ?30 per kg it is profitable for both farmers and us.1310The quantity of feed needed would also drastically reduce since 5g of BSFL would compensate for 10g of the ordinary food feed. The black soldier flies are found in climates similar to that found in Kerala but are not found in any of the neighbouring states. This implies decomposition of waste in BSF farms would mean not only ensuring economic stability but economic growth without compromising the effectiveness of the waste disposal method.

Flower waste needs pretreatments like drying, followed by mechanical pretreatment of crushing the flowers. Flower waste is slightly acidic in nature. It should be treated with alkaline chemicals like sodium carbonate (washing soda) solution to enhance its biodigestibility. A fixed dome or a floating drum type bio-digester will be used to carry out anaerobic digestion of flower waste, which produces raw biogas containing around 55-60 percent of combustible methane gas. The raw biogas with less methane percentage can be useful for cooking purpose or at the place of its generation. To make biogas as a high energy fuel, removal of contaminants like carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and moisture should be removed from raw biogas. The upgraded biogas can be a transportable by filling it inside the cylinder by using a compressor. Co-digestion of floral waste along with food waste is also feasible, to obtain enhanced biogas production at potential locations such as renowned temples having huge quantities of floral waste and food waste.

252,IDEAAP005178,Madduri Chandrakeerthi,ANDHRA PRADESH,PRAKASAM,A SMART HELMET,The proposed idea has been published in the names of parent institution and team members. ,"The increased prevalence of worker fatalities at mines and construction sites inspired this approach. The current concept is to safeguard construction employees from any damages and injuries while on the job. A Miners HELMET with different sensors, including an ultrasonic sensor, a GPS tracker, and a heartbeat sensor, as well as a carrier to communicate with co-workers and a solar backup unit that can light up the torch on the Miners Helmet, are all included in the suggested design. The existing one lacks a heart rate sensor and a torch with solar backup, both of which are critical for worker safety.","Working on the site as a miner or a construction worker is incredibly dangerous. Workers end up falling over a cliff and being crushed by stones, as well as being dumped into trenches excavated by others. This invention is proposed in order to avoid these unplanned disasters. A hard Miners Hat with sensors which includes a temperature sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and heartbeat sensor to prevent such events. All of these sensors are linked together via an Arduino microcontroller, allowing them to interact. To power the sensors, solar-batteries or easily accessible rechargeable batteries are used. A temperature sensor determines if the temperature around the worker is dangerous, while an ultrasonic sensor informs the worker when an object approaches. A heartbeat sensor monitors a workers physical condition and informs co-workers while also providing information about the person in risk. Even if the injured worker is located, the location is imprecise, thus the model incorporates a GPS tracker in the Miners Hat that may be used to identify the injured workers location so that a co-worker can assist him. In the mining and construction industries, this invention assures worker safety and security.","The mining industry is important to the economy. Because India is a developing country, citizens are required to work on a daily basis in order to earn a living this includes jobs such as miner and construction workers. Working as a miner or a construction worker on the site is extremely hazardous. Employees end up falling from a cliff and being crushed by stones, as well as entering into dug trenches. This idea plays a key role in preventing all of these mishaps before occurring in mining and construction sites. The proposed solution is to protect employees from risks and assist them in resolving difficulties. Its done by integrating various sensors to alert the worker to potential dangers such as heatstroke, dizziness, and suffocation. To monitor these characteristics, temperature sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and heartbeat sensors are all housed in one piece on that Miners Hat.","Mines are regarded as high-risk environments in India. Because of the danger to their lives, many people are unwilling to work there. By providing workers with the necessary safety equipment and assuring their safety, many more people may be interested in working in mines because the chance of death is reduced. They are the most important components of the MADE IN INDIA programme. Mining businesses will gain from embracing our proposal since they will be able to give the highest quality safety equipment for their employees. Manpower grows as the percentage of mine employees who are safe increases. The export of minerals from mines can be enhanced by increasing labour. As a result, demand for the suggested helmet grows.","Mentor-1: Dr. Merugu Kavitha, Associate Professor, Dept., of EEE, Head-Product Development, QIS College of Engineering and Technology, Ongole, Prakasam Dist., Andhra Pradesh- 523272.

254,IDEAKR005232,S K Aruna,KARNATAKA,BENGALURU (URBAN),Biodegradable Hydrogel gauze from Nano Sericin  and Gelatin,"Hydrogels based on Nano sericin- gelatin is a remarkable output for developing wound  dressing that could accelerate healing and could be peeled off without damaging the newly  formed skin. These Nano sericin- gelatin hydrogels are ideal for drug delivery applications and  tissue engineering. Hydrogel matrix produced from sericin shows excellent cell homing ability,  Cell-Cell adhesion and cell proliferation which makes them suitable for wound healing  application. Gelatin, a hydrolysed product of collagen, is a crucial member in this field. It can be  chemically / enzymatically cross-linked to get a stable hydrogel product. Porous scaffolds from  this can be made by freeze drying and phase separation methods. Cross-linking two biopolymers,  Nano sericin and gelatin, would produce a biodegradable and biocompatible hydrogel system  having sufficient hydrophilicity, strength, and handling characteristics that can be used for  biomedical applications. These products are a hot topic in the field of biomaterial research. The  present proposal can be considered as a pioneer work, which has to be explored further in terms  of biological evaluation for use as a potential wound dressing material. This is the first report  from nano sericin and gelatin based hydrogel for medical and pharmaceutical applications.","The proposed work can be used to produce a cheap, environmental- friendly  biodegradable Hydrogel Gauze by using Sericin and Gelatin. Proteinaceous substance Sericin from silkworm is discarded by the degumming process while extracting silk fibroin. Gelatin can be extracted from the collagen of scales and bones of fish. The cost of disposal for the above wastage is very high. The proposed work  tries to convert the disposed parts into eco-friendly Nano sericin-gelatin crosslinked  hydrogel based gauze for wound healing application without any chemical cross linkers.  1310","Concept : 1310The major components of silk cocoon fibers are fibroin and sericin. The silk industry obtains silk fibers after degumming, processing 0.4 million tons of dry cocoons, generates about 0.05 million tons of sericin protein as waste which is released into the environment causing pollution.1310Most Ffsh wastes are rich in collagen which is a great source of gelatin.  70 percentage of the total caught fish produces around 20-80 percentage of fish waste. 30 percentage of wastage is from bones, head, skins and scales. Cost of fish waste disposal is very high.1310By blending nano sericin and gelatine, biodegradable polymers can be produced.This opens perspectives in developing hydrogels with water retaining capacity. These hydrogels can be produced using cost effective fabrication techniques without chemical cross-linkers.The above produced product can be used for wound healing application in the medical field. 1310Objective  13108216Biodegradable Hydrogels from Nano Sericin  Gelatin8217 work has the following main objectives.13101. To study the characteristics of Sericin, Gelatin and different fabrication techniques without chemical cross-linkers.13102.

Crosslinking of biopolymers hydrogels13105. In vitro and In vivo evaluation of hydrogel for wound healing gauze.1310","Reusing the bio wastages into green materials will boost the jobs and the competitiveness of the recycling industry. It also reduces production cost of the hydrogels. This could make our country more competitive and help to overcome our dependence on the supply of healing gels. Enabling the Indian market to promote the creation of new companies by not only in recycling, but also in the transformation of waste raw materials into medical products.1310Positive result has been obtained by combining polymers of different biomaterials using different techniques like blending,grafting, chemical cross-linking reactions and electro spinning.with the advent of cloning and genetic engineering techniques to express both native and synthetic biomaterials in a variety of host systems, there remains a bright future for biopolymeric use in medicine.1310In the field of Tissue Engineering, research on development of 3D Scaffolds supports tissue regeneration and biomatrix which supports cues and signals to promote functional tissues connections. These biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric-based nanoparticulation can also be applied in wound-healing applications via delivery of bioactive agents. Current clinical wound-healing applications play a much more passive role, and development of this technology will help with better, more efficient wound healing.","1.
