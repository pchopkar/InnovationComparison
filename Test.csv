2	3.0	IDEATN002766	ANISH JOHN PAUL M	TAMIL NADU	KANNIYAKUMARI	Coconut Leaf Midrib Extractor	NO	The manual process needs more man power and it consumes more amount of time .our new innovative machine can easily remove the midrib from the coconut leaf. By the usage of this machine, the speed of the removal process is 10 times more than the manual process. This method will help the farmers to reduce their work and also ease the risks.1310	82269To develop coconut midrib extraction machine for the coconut farmers131082269To develop cost effective machine to reduce the time consumption and manual process. 1310	The proposed machine will be used for the peoples engaged in the coconut farming. The proposed machine will improve the livelihood of those workers in the rural areas.	8226People involved in coconut farming from the different places in the country131013108226Small scale Industries related to coconut midrib exports.131013108226cottage industries1310	Dr. V.

0	1.0	IDEATS002757	Sakhineti Mounika	TELANGANA	MEDCHAL MALKAJGIRI	Smart Wheel chair with Robotic ARM		For those with neuromuscular or spinal cord injuries that results in upper extremity impairments ,the most basic tasks like picking any items  , drinking or eating with a spoon can be nearly impossible . among such patients , the ability to reach accurately and  manipulate object is consistently rated as one of their most important challenges.1310Assistive Robotics can fill the gap. we are proposing the uniqueness of mounting humanoid robotic arm with Wheel chair to provide an increased sense of independence for users and this reduce the need for caretaker . However these devices are still very costly , making them virtually inaccessible to most of the people who need them . this is largely due to the expensive parts needed to enable the arm to adapt to the user and the environment in real time. The ability of robotic arms to benefit people today is largely limited due to high cost and excessive power consumption. 1310Now we are exploring the implementation of adaptive controls of hardware in an effort to address the need for a collaborative , user friendly , accurate robotic arm at a significantly reduced cost.1310	We believe that the development of a robotic arm based on neuromorphic (who is having spinal problem ) can be a game changer for people with disability ,it could make it easier for them to engage with community , boost their independence, and grant them employment opportunities . the expected cost and performance improvements are potentially disruptive to this market.13109The goal of this product is to produce assistive humanoid robotic arm for patients with wheel chairs. To do their basic tasks like picking ,dinking water , controlling the Home appliances , finishing the home works , controlling their own wheel chair etc..,1310	1)Hospitals 2) Airport 3) House Hold users 4) Old Age Homes	According to the survey in India IIT madras says that india currently importing total three lakh wheel chairs annually. Products with comparable features are available only in the global market and are three to five times more expensive.  And there are no commercial manufacturersin india for this market.      1310  The global wheelchairs market is expected to reach a value of about US 6,253.6 Mn by the end of 2026, expanding at a high single digit CAGR during the forecast period. Rise in geriatric population, increase in disabled population, adoption and awareness of advanced wheelchairs products, improvement in healthcare infrastructure, and favorable reimbursement policies are expected to boost the global wheelchairs market during the forecast period.1310	Dr.Sudharsan Jayabalan , Associate Professor , Dept of ECE , GRIET ,HYderabad	10 years of Teaching Experience	9551250587 / sudharsa.jayabalangmail.com	3D Designing and Simulation process is executed and waiting for further funds for deployment.	1 year for market ready product	Healthcare & Life sciences, Medical Devices, Pharmaceuticals, Biotech, AYUSH and any related sub-sector	Approved
